  The `<copperpour />` element (also known as a groundplane) fills large areas of a layer
  with copper tied to a specific net, helping with return paths, shielding, and
  thermal performance.

## Overview

The `<copperpour />` element lets you quickly create a copper pour (groundplane) that
is connected to a specific net. Groundplanes improve signal integrity by giving
high-frequency and return currents a short path, reduce electromagnetic
interference, and act as a thermal sink for heat-producing components.

A copper pour automatically flows around component keep-outs and pads while
maintaining a clearance gap that you control.

## Basic Usage

Add a copper pour to any board by connecting it to a net—most commonly
`net.GND`. The example below shows a top-layer pour surrounding a chip, with a
few traces stitching components back to ground.

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`
  export default () => (
    <board
      width="30mm"
      height="20mm"
    >
      <chip name="U1" footprint="soic8" pcbX={-6} pcbY={0} />
      <resistor name="R1" resistance="10k" footprint="0402" pcbX={6} pcbY={4} />
      <capacitor name="C1" capacitance="100nF" footprint="0402" pcbX={6} pcbY={-4} />
      <trace from=".R1 > .pin2" to="net.GND" />
      <trace from=".C1 > .pin2" to="net.GND" />
      <trace from=".U1 > .pin4" to="net.GND" />
      <copperpour connectsTo="net.GND" layer="top" clearance="0.15mm" />
    </board>
  )
`} />

## Copper Pour Properties

| Property | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `connectsTo` | Net that the pour is tied to. Often `net.GND` or `net.VCC`. | `"net.GND"` |
| `layer` | PCB layer for the pour (`"top"`, `"bottom"`, or an inner layer name). | `"top"` |
| `clearance` | Default minimum distance between the pour and other features (e.g. pads, traces, board edge). This is used as a fallback for specific margin properties. Defaults to `0.2mm`. | `"0.3mm"` |
| `padMargin` | Minimum distance from component pads. Overrides `clearance`. | `"0.4mm"` |
| `traceMargin` | Minimum distance from traces on other nets. Overrides `clearance`. | `"0.1mm"` |
| `boardEdgeMargin` | Minimum distance from the board edge. Overrides `clearance`. | `"2mm"` |
| `cutoutMargin` | Minimum distance from board cutouts. Overrides `clearance`. | `"0.1mm"` |
| `thermalRelief` | Configure spoke width/count when attaching to pads. | `{ spokeWidth: "0.3mm", spokeCount: 4 }` |
| `outline` | Optional polygon describing a custom pour boundary. | `[{ x: -10, y: -8 }, { x: 10, y: -8 }, ...]` |

## Creating Pours on Multiple Layers

You can add separate pours for different layers to create stitched groundplanes
or dedicated power planes.

<CircuitPreview leftView="pcb" rightView="schematic" code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="28mm" height="18mm">
      <chip name="U1" footprint="qfn32" pcbX={0} pcbY={0} />
      <resistor
        name="R1"
        resistance="10k"
        footprint="0402"
        layer="bottom"
        pcbX={5}
        pcbY={5}
        connections={{
          pin1: "net.GND",
          pin2: "net.VCC",
        }}
      />
      <trace from=".U1 > .pin8" to="net.GND" />
      <trace from=".U1 > .pin24" to="net.VCC" />
      <copperpour connectsTo="net.GND" layer="top" clearance="0.25mm" />
      <copperpour connectsTo="net.VCC" layer="bottom" clearance="0.25mm" />
    </board>
  )
`} />

Use vias tied to the same net to stitch pours between layers and further reduce
impedance.

## Tips for Effective Groundplanes

- Keep sensitive signal traces short and route them over solid groundplane
  areas when possible.
- Use consistent clearances—tight enough to maximize copper, but wide enough to
  satisfy fabrication rules.
- Add stitching vias between pours on different layers to reduce loop area.
- Consider splitting pours if you need isolated analog and digital ground
  regions, connecting them at a single point.

`<copperpour />` makes it easy to drop in broad ground coverage with sensible
defaults, while still giving you the control needed for detailed PCB layout.
