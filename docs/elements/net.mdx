## Overview

The `<net />` element represents a bunch of traces that are all connected. You
should use nets for representing power buses such as "V5", "V3_3" and "GND"

When using a `<net />`, you're being less specific than 

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <group>
      <capacitor capacitance="1uF" footprint="0603" name="C1" />
      <net name="V5" />
      <trace from="net.V5" to=".C1 .pos" />
    </group>
  )
  `}
/>


## Net Properties

Nets can have properties that will pass onto any PCB trace within them. The 
trace properties can be automatically used for autorouting adjustments or to
validate connections (such as validating that a chip is connected to a power
source)

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `isForPower`  | The net is used to deliver power ("V5", "V3_3") |  
| `isGround` | The net is used as a ground path |

## Implicit Nets

If you use a net in a [port or net selector](../guides/port-and-net-selectors.md)
e.g. `"net.V5"` and there is not `<net name="V5" />`, then you
