The `<board />` element is a root element that contains all the chips and traces
to create a PCB.

You can think of a `<board />` like a `<body />` element in HTML. Everything
goes in a board!


import CircuitPreview from '@site/src/components/CircuitPreview'

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`

  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <resistor resistance="1k" footprint="0402" name="R1" />
    </board>
  )

`} />


## Board Properties

### Customizing the Size of the Board

Generally you'll use the `width` and `height` properties to define the size of
the board.

### Setting the `autorouter`

Boards or [subcircuits](./subcircuit.mdx) can specify what autorouter should be
used to route any traces within them.

Usually you'll want to use an autorouter preset:

- `autorouter="auto"` - Uses the [platform configuration](../guides/running-tscircuit/platform-configuration.md). For tscircuit.com this defaults to `sequential-trace`.
- `autorouter="sequential-trace"` - Iterate over each trace and use tscircuit's fast built-in autorouter. This method is fast and deterministic but often fails with over 50 traces.
- `autorouter="auto-local"` - Use the platform configuration, but only route locally (do not make API calls)
- `autorouter="auto-cloud"` - Use the platform configuration for 

For complex boards with over 50 traces, you should use `autorouter="auto-cloud"`
to take advantage of tscircuit's cloud autorouters, which internally use the popular
[freerouting](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting) library.

You can also specify a custom autorouter object to use your own autorouter.

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`
  export default () => (
    <board
      width="20mm"
      height="20mm"
      autorouter={{
        serverUrl: "https://registry-api.tscircuit.com",
        serverMode: "job",
        inputFormat: "simplified",
      }}
    >
      <chip name="U1" footprint="soic8" pcbX={5} pcbY={0} />
      <resistor
        name="R1"
        pcbX={-5}
        pcbY={0}
        resistance={100}
        footprint="0402"
      />
      <trace from=".U1 > .pin1" to=".R1 > .pin1" />
    </board>
  )
`} />

### Custom Board Outlines

You can specify a custom outline for your board by passing an `outline` prop.
The PCB you get will have this outline cut out, this is great when you want a
board that's not a rectangle!

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`

export default () => (
  <board
    outline={[
      { x: -22.5, y: 24.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 24.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: 20.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: 20.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 2.5 },
      { x: 18, y: -1.5 },
      { x: 18, y: -18 },
      { x: -18, y: -18 },
      { x: -18, y: -1.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 2.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: -20.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: -20.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 24.5 },
    ]}

    // These are currently required due to this issue:
    // https://github.com/tscircuit/core/issues/564
    width="50mm"
    height="50mm"
  />
)

`} />

### Offseting the board origin

When you supply an `outline`, the `width` and `height` props still define the
board's rectangular bounding box and the coordinate system used by `pcbX` and
`pcbY`. If you would like the origin `(0, 0)` to line up with a different part
of your custom outline, provide `outlineOffsetX` and `outlineOffsetY` in tandem
with `width` and `height`. The offsets shift the outline relative to the
bounding box (measured in millimeters), letting you keep intuitive coordinates
for parts while still rendering the outline exactly where you want it.

For example, this board keeps the origin at the lower-left corner by defining a
40&nbsp;mm by 30&nbsp;mm bounding box and shifting the outline half the width and
height back toward negative space:

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`

export default () => (
  <board
    width="40mm"
    height="30mm"
    outline={[
      { x: 0, y: 0 },
      { x: 40, y: 0 },
      { x: 40, y: 30 },
      { x: 0, y: 30 },
    ]}
    outlineOffsetX={-20}
    outlineOffsetY={-15}
  >
    <chip name="U1" footprint="qfn32" pcbX={5} pcbY={5} />
    <resistor name="R1" footprint="0402" resistance="1k" pcbX={10} pcbY={12} />
  </board>
)

`}
/>
