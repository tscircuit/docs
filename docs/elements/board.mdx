The `<board />` element is a root element that contains all the chips and traces
to create a PCB.

You can think of a `<board />` like a `<body />` element in HTML. Everything
goes in a board!


import CircuitPreview from '@site/src/components/CircuitPreview'

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`

  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <resistor resistance="1k" footprint="0402" name="R1" />
    </board>
  )

`} />


## Board Properties

### Customizing the Size of the Board

Generally you'll use the `width` and `height` properties to define the size of
the board.

### Setting the `autorouter`

Boards or [subcircuits](./subcircuit.mdx) can specify what autorouter should be
used to route any traces within them.

Usually you'll want to use an autorouter preset:

- `autorouter="auto"` - Uses the [platform configuration](../guides/running-tscircuit/platform-configuration.md). For tscircuit.com this defaults to `sequential-trace`.
- `autorouter="sequential-trace"` - Iterate over each trace and use tscircuit's fast built-in autorouter. This method is fast and deterministic but often fails with over 50 traces.
- `autorouter="auto-local"` - Use the platform configuration, but only route locally (do not make API calls)
- `autorouter="auto-cloud"` - Use the platform configuration for 

For complex boards with over 50 traces, you should use `autorouter="auto-cloud"`
to take advantage of tscircuit's cloud autorouters, which internally use the popular
[freerouting](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting) library.

You can also specify a custom autorouter object to use your own autorouter.

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`
  export default () => (
    <board
      width="20mm"
      height="20mm"
      autorouter={{
        serverUrl: "https://registry-api.tscircuit.com",
        serverMode: "job",
        inputFormat: "simplified",
      }}
    >
      <chip name="U1" footprint="soic8" pcbX={5} pcbY={0} />
      <resistor
        name="R1"
        pcbX={-5}
        pcbY={0}
        resistance={100}
        footprint="0402"
      />
      <trace from=".U1 > .pin1" to=".R1 > .pin1" />
    </board>
  )
`} />

### Custom Board Outlines

You can specify a custom outline for your board by passing an `outline` prop.
The PCB you get will have this outline cut out, this is great when you want a
board that's not a rectangle!

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`

export default () => (
  <board
    outline={[
      { x: -22.5, y: 24.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 24.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: 20.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: 20.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 2.5 },
      { x: 18, y: -1.5 },
      { x: 18, y: -18 },
      { x: -18, y: -18 },
      { x: -18, y: -1.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 2.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: -20.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: -20.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 24.5 },
    ]}

    // These are currently required due to this issue:
    // https://github.com/tscircuit/core/issues/564
    width="50mm"
    height="50mm"
  />
)

`} />

### Offseting the board origin

`width` and `height` set the board's bounding box (and thus the `pcbX`/`pcbY`
coordinate system) even when you're using a custom outline. Add
`outlineOffsetX` and `outlineOffsetY`—measured in millimeters, whether passed as
numbers or strings like `"5mm"`—to slide that outline relative to the bounding
box so `(0, 0)` lands where you expect. Positive offsets push the outline toward
increasing `pcbX`/`pcbY` coordinates.

In this example the outline is shifted half the board's width and height so the
origin stays at the lower-left corner while the shape itself is centered:

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`

export default () => (
  <board
    width="40mm"
    height="30mm"
    outlineOffsetX="20mm"
    outlineOffsetY="15mm"
  >
    <chip name="U1" footprint="qfn32" pcbX={5} pcbY={5} />
    <resistor name="R1" footprint="0402" resistance="1k" pcbX={10} pcbY={12} />
  </board>
)

`}
/>
