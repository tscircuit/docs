## Overview

A `<mountedboard />` is a component that represents a smaller PCB (daughterboard or
module) mounted onto a parent board. Unlike a regular `<board />` which is the root
PCB, a `<mountedboard />` is nested inside a parent board and is linked to it via
the `carrier_pcb_board_id` property.

This is useful for:
- Modular PCB designs
- Daughterboard/daughtercard configurations
- Plug-in modules (e.g., an ESP32 module mounted on a main board)
- Separating complex circuits into manageable smaller boards

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="50mm" height="50mm">
      <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" pcbX={-10} pcbY={0} />
      <resistor name="R2" resistance="10k" footprint="0402" pcbX={10} pcbY={0} />

      <mountedboard width="15mm" height="15mm" pcbX={0} pcbY={15}>
        <chip name="U1" footprint="qfn32" pcbX={0} pcbY={0} />
      </mountedboard>

## MountedBoard vs Regular Board

| Feature | `<board>` | `<mountedboard>` |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Hierarchy | Root/top-level | Nested inside a `<board>` |
| Carrier | None (it's the carrier) | Has `carrier_pcb_board_id` linking to parent |
| Use case | Main PCB | Daughterboard/module |

## Basic Usage

```tsx
export default () => (
  <board width="50mm" height="50mm">
    {/* Main board components */}
    <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" pcbX={-10} pcbY={0} />

    {/* A smaller board mounted onto this main board */}
    <mountedboard width="10mm" height="10mm" pcbX={0} pcbY={15}>
      <chip name="U1" footprint="qfn32" pcbX={0} pcbY={0} />
    </mountedboard>

    <trace from=".R1 > .pin1" to=".U1 > .pin1" />
  </board>
)
```

## Properties

In addition to common layout properties (like `pcbX`, `pcbY`, `schX`, `schY`, `rotation`, `name`), MountedBoard supports:

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `width` | `string \| number` | Width of the mounted board in millimeters |
| `height` | `string \| number` | Height of the mounted board in millimeters |
| `boardToBoardDistance` | `Distance` | Distance between the mounted board and carrier board |
| `mountOrientation` | `"faceDown" \| "faceUp"` | Orientation of the mounted board relative to carrier |

Note: Unlike `<board>`, `<mountedboard>` uses `pcbX`/`pcbY` to position on the parent board, not `center`.

## MountedBoard in Schematic View

When using `<mountedboard />`, the components inside it appear in the schematic
as part of the parent circuit:

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="50mm" height="50mm">
      <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" schX={-10} />

      <mountedboard width="15mm" height="15mm" schX={10}>
        <chip name="U1" footprint="qfn32" />
      </mountedboard>

      <trace from=".R1 > .pin1" to=".U1 > .pin1" />
    </board>
  )
  `}
/>

## Use Cases

### Daughterboard Configuration

MountedBoard is ideal for modular designs where you have a smaller module that
plugs into or is soldered onto a main board:

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="60mm" height="40mm">
      {/* Main power circuitry on the carrier board */}
      <capacitor name="C1" capacitance="10uF" footprint="0805" pcbX={-20} pcbY={0} />
      <capacitor name="C2" capacitance="10uF" footprint="0805" pcbX={-15} pcbY={0} />

      {/* Module mounted on the main board */}
      <mountedboard width="25mm" height="18mm" pcbX={10} pcbY={0}>
        <chip name="U1" footprint="soic8" pcbX={0} pcbY={0} />
      </mountedboard>

      <trace from=".C1 > .pin1" to=".U1 > .pin1" />
    </board>
  )
  `}
/>

This pattern allows you to:
- Design the daughterboard independently
- Reuse the same module across multiple projects
- Keep complex circuits organized in separate boards
