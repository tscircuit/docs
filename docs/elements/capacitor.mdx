## Overview

A `<capacitor />` stores electrical energy in an electric field. Capacitors are commonly used for filtering, energy storage, and timing circuits. Unlike resistors, capacitors can be polarized (like electrolytic capacitors) or non-polarized (like ceramic capacitors).

A capacitor element has two pins. Polarized capacitors must be placed with correct orientation to avoid damage.

When specifying a capacitor, you'll need to provide a footprint string (like `0402` or `0805`) and capacitance value. Popular capacitor types and sizes can be found at [jlcsearch](https://jlcsearch.tscircuit.com/capacitors/list).

  export default () => (
    <capacitor
      name="C2"
      footprint="axial_p5mm"
      capacitance="10μF"
      polarized
    />
  )

## Pins

A capacitor has the following pins and aliases:

| Pin # | Aliases (Polarized) | Description |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| pin1 | pos, anode, left | The positive terminal (required for polarized capacitors) |
| pin2 | neg, cathode, right | The negative terminal (must be connected properly for polarized caps) |

:::warning
For polarized capacitors, you must connect the positive and negative pins correctly. Reversing polarity can cause capacitor failure or even explosion!

## Specifications

Capacitors can be configured with these key properties:

- **capacitance** - The capacitance value specified as a string e.g. `"100nF"` or `"2.2μF"`
- **voltageRating** - Maximum voltage the capacitor can handle e.g. `"25V"`
- **tolerance** - Capacitance tolerance percentage e.g. `"±10%"`
- **temperatureCoefficient** - Temperature stability specification e.g. `"X7R"`
- **equivalentSeriesResistance** - ESR value for critical applications e.g. `"0.5Ω"`

## Automatic Part Selection

Like resistors, tscircuit will automatically select suitable capacitor parts based on your specifications through the [platform parts engine](../guides/platform-configuration.md). For specialized capacitors (e.g., low ESR, high voltage), you may want to specify `supplierPartNumbers` explicitly.

## Schematic Orientation

Polarized capacitors can display their positive and negative pins in different orientations. Use the `schOrientation` property to control the symbol orientation instead of manually setting `schRotation`.

Valid orientation values are:

- `horizontal`
- `vertical`
- `pos_left`
- `pos_right`
- `pos_top`
- `pos_bottom`
- `neg_left`
- `neg_right`
- `neg_top`
- `neg_bottom`

```tsx
<capacitor
  name="C1"
  capacitance="1uF"
  polarized
  schOrientation="pos_left"
  schX={0}
  schY={0}
  connections={{ pos: "net.POS", neg: "net.NEG" }}
/>```
