## Overview

A via is a plated hole that connects different layers of a PCB. Vias are
commonly used to route traces between layers and for thermal management.

Vias do not have a schematic representation.

You generally do not need to manually create vias, they will be handled
automatically by the [autorouter](./board.mdx#setting-the-autorouter).

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`export default () => (
    <via
      fromLayer="top"
      toLayer="bottom"
      outerDiameter="0.8mm"
      holeDiameter="0.4mm"
      pcbX={10}
      pcbY={10}
    />
  )`}
/>

## Properties


| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| fromLayer | string | "top" | Starting layer for the via |
| toLayer | string | "bottom" | Ending layer for the via |
| holeDiameter | number \| string | "0.4mm" | Diameter of the plated hole |
| outerDiameter | number \| string | "0.8mm" | Outer diameter of the copper annular ring |
| pcbX | number | 0 | PCB X position of the via |
| pcbY | number | 0 | PCB Y position of the via |
