## Overview

A via is a plated hole that connects different layers of a PCB. Vias are
commonly used to route traces between layers and for thermal management.

Vias do not have a schematic representation.

You generally do not need to manually create vias, they will be handled
automatically by the [autorouter](./board.mdx#setting-the-autorouter).

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`export default () => (
    <via
      fromLayer="top"
      toLayer="bottom"
      outerDiameter="0.8mm"
      holeDiameter="0.4mm"
      pcbX={10}
      pcbY={10}
    />
  )`}
/>

## Properties


| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| fromLayer | string | "top" | Starting layer for the via |
| toLayer | string | "bottom" | Ending layer for the via |
| holeDiameter | number \| string | "0.4mm" | Diameter of the plated hole |
| outerDiameter | number \| string | "0.8mm" | Outer diameter of the copper annular ring |
| pcbX | number | 0 | PCB X position of the via |
| pcbY | number | 0 | PCB Y position of the via |
| netIsAssignable | boolean | `false` | Marks the via as prefabricated so autorouters like `laser_prefab` can claim it for any compatible net |

### Prefabricated vias for laser routing

The [`laser_prefab` autorouter](./board.mdx#setting-the-autorouter) pairs with
prefabricated ("biscuit") via templates used in laser ablation workflows.
Setting `netIsAssignable` on a via marks it as reusable so the autorouter can
repurpose the hole for whichever net needs to switch layers during routing.

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm" autorouter="laser_prefab">
      <testpoint name="TP_TOP" footprintVariant="pad" pcbX={0} pcbY={4} layer="top" />
      <testpoint name="TP_BOTTOM" footprintVariant="pad" pcbX={0} pcbY={-4} layer="bottom" />
      <via
        name="V_ASSIGNABLE"
        pcbX={0}
        pcbY={0}
        fromLayer="top"
        toLayer="bottom"
        holeDiameter="0.3mm"
        outerDiameter="0.6mm"
        netIsAssignable
      />
      <trace from="TP_TOP.pin1" to="V_ASSIGNABLE.top" />
      <trace from="V_ASSIGNABLE.bottom" to="TP_BOTTOM.pin1" />
    </board>
  )`}
/>

Unused assignable vias keep their original net, while claimed vias are updated
to match the completed connection. For a full walkthrough, see the
[Biscuit Board Laser Ablation guide](../guides/tscircuit-essentials/biscuit-board-laser-ablation.mdx).
