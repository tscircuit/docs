## Overview

A via is a plated hole that connects different layers of a PCB. Vias are
commonly used to route traces between layers and for thermal management.

Vias do not have a schematic representation.

You generally do not need to manually create vias, they will be handled
automatically by the [autorouter](./board.mdx#setting-the-autorouter).

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`export default () => (
    <via
      fromLayer="top"
      toLayer="bottom"
      outerDiameter="0.8mm"
      holeDiameter="0.4mm"
      pcbX={10}
      pcbY={10}
    />
  )`}

## Properties


| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| fromLayer | string | "top" | Starting layer for the via |
| toLayer | string | "bottom" | Ending layer for the via |
| holeDiameter | number \| string | "0.4mm" | Diameter of the plated hole |
| outerDiameter | number \| string | "0.8mm" | Outer diameter of the copper annular ring |
| pcbX | number | 0 | PCB X position of the via |
| pcbY | number | 0 | PCB Y position of the via |
| netIsAssignable | boolean | `false` | Marks the via as prefabricated so autorouters like `laser_prefab` can claim it for any compatible net |

### Prefabricated vias for laser routing

The [`laser_prefab` autorouter](./board.mdx#setting-the-autorouter) is designed
for fabrication flows that combine laser ablation with pre-drilled or templated
vias. These workflows start with a "biscuit" carrier board that already contains
a precise matrix of holes. Copper is laminated onto the carrier and a laser
ablates the top copper to define traces before the template's vias are filled or
re-plated.

When you mark a via with `netIsAssignable`, the autorouter exports an
**assignable obstacle** so the router can reuse the via for whichever net needs
to cross layers during routing. This lets you place a library of vias ahead of
time while still giving the autorouter flexibility to finish the layout. You can
still pre-assign a net to the via in your design; the autorouter only replaces
that assignment if a different trace claims the via.

:::tip
Group all of the prefabricated vias together—usually in a separate subcircuit or
component library—so you can reuse the same biscuit template across multiple
projects. The `netIsAssignable` flag prevents unused vias from shorting random
nets while remaining available to complete new connections.

<CircuitPreview

  code={`export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm" autorouter="laser_prefab">
      <testpoint name="TP_TOP" footprintVariant="pad" pcbX={0} pcbY={4} layer="top" />
      <testpoint name="TP_BOTTOM" footprintVariant="pad" pcbX={0} pcbY={-4} layer="bottom" />
      <via
        name="V_ASSIGNABLE"
        pcbX={0}
        pcbY={0}
        fromLayer="top"
        toLayer="bottom"
        holeDiameter="0.3mm"
        outerDiameter="0.6mm"
        netIsAssignable
      />
      <trace from="TP_TOP.pin1" to="V_ASSIGNABLE.top" />
      <trace from="V_ASSIGNABLE.bottom" to="TP_BOTTOM.pin1" />
    </board>
  )`}
/>

When the board renders, any assignable via that remains unused keeps its
original net assignment. Otherwise, the autorouter replaces its net with the one
required for the completed connection. For an end-to-end workflow, read the
[Biscuit Board Laser Ablation guide](../guides/tscircuit-essentials/biscuit-board-laser-ablation.mdx).
