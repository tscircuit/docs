## Overview

The `<trace />` element represents an electrical connection between two or more points in your circuit. Traces can connect components, nets, or specific pins on components.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example connecting two components:

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" pcbX={-2} schX={-2} />
      <capacitor name="C1" capacitance="100nF" footprint="0402" pcbX={2} />
      <trace
        from=".R1 > .pin1"
        to=".C1 > .pin1"
      />
    </board>
  )
`} />

## Trace Properties

| Property | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `from` | Starting point of the trace using a [port selector](../guides/port-and-net-selectors.md) | `".R1 > .pin1"` |
| `to` | Ending point of the trace using a [port selector](../guides/port-and-net-selectors.md) | `".C1 > .pin1"` |
| `maxLength` | Maximum length the trace can be (optional) | `"10mm"` |
| `minLength` | Minimum length the trace must be (optional) | `"5mm"` |
| `width` | Width of the trace (optional) | `"0.2mm"` |
| `pcbPath` | Array of points defining a manual PCB path relative to an anchor port | `[{ x: 1, y: 0 }, { x: 1, y: 1 }]` |
| `pcbPathRelativeTo` | Port selector that `pcbPath` coordinates are relative to (defaults to the `from` port) | `".R1 > .pin2"` |

## Connecting to Nets

Traces can connect to named nets like power and ground:

<CircuitPreview defaultView="schematic" code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" />
      <trace from=".R1 > .pin1" to="net.GND" />
      <trace from=".R1 > .pin2" to="net.VCC" />
    </board>
  )
`} />

## Autorouting

Traces are automatically routed by tscircuit's [autorouting system](./board.mdx#setting-the-autorouter). The autorouter will:

1. Find a path between components that doesn't intersect other traces
2. Use vias to change layers when needed
3. Respect any length constraints specified
4. Try to minimize the number of vias used

You can customize the autorouting behavior by setting the `autorouter` property on the parent [`<board />`](./board.mdx) or [`<subcircuit />`](./subcircuit.mdx).

## Manual PCB Paths

Sometimes you may want to manually specify the exact path a trace should take on the PCB. Provide a list of points with `pcbPath` to override autorouting and draw the route yourself. The coordinates are relative to a specific port defined by `pcbPathRelativeTo` (defaults to the `from` port).

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="20mm" height="10mm">
      <resistor name="R1" resistance="10k" footprint="0402" pcbX={-3} />
      <resistor name="R2" resistance="10k" footprint="0402" pcbX={3} />
      <trace
        from=".R1 > .pin2"
        to=".R2 > .pin1"
        pcbPathRelativeTo=".R1 > .pin2"
        pcbPath={[
          { x: 1, y: 0 },
          { x: 1, y: 1 },
          { x: 4, y: 1 },
          { x: 4, y: 0 },
        ]}
      />
    </board>
  )
`} />

## Length Constraints

Sometimes you need traces to be exactly a certain length, like for high-speed signals. You can use `maxLength` and `minLength`:

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`
export default () => (
  <board width="20mm" height="20mm">
    <chip name="U1" footprint="soic8" pcbX={-5} />
    <chip name="U2" footprint="soic8" pcbX={5} />
    <trace
      from=".U1 > .pin1"
      to=".U2 > .pin1"
      maxLength="15mm"
      minLength="12mm"
    />
  </board>
)
`} />

## Differential Pairs

For high-speed signals, you often need pairs of traces to have matched lengths. You can use the `differentialPairKey` property to group traces:

:::info
The `differentialPairKey` property is in beta and not available on all autorouters yet!
:::

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="20mm" height="20mm">
      <chip name="U1" footprint="soic8" pcbX={-5} />
      <chip name="U2" footprint="soic8" pcbX={5} />
      <trace
        from=".U1 > .pin1"
        to=".U2 > .pin1"
        differentialPairKey="pair1"
      />
      <trace
        from=".U1 > .pin2"
        to=".U2 > .pin2"
        differentialPairKey="pair1"
      />
    </board>
  )
`} />

The autorouter will ensure both traces in the pair have the same length.

## Net vs Direct connections

There are generally two ways that traces are represented on a PCB "Rats Nest" 
or on a schematic and they have very different results:

- **Net** - A trace that connects a net to a component pin.
  - `<trace from="net.GND" to=".R1 > .pin1" />`
- **Direct** - A trace that connects two component pins directly.
  - `<trace from=".R1 > .pin1" to=".C2 > .pin2" />`

When you specify a trace with a net, the autorouter will look for the best
place to tie into the net. This means you're not specifying the exact location
where the trace will go.

When using net connections we use a Rats Nest on a PCB view or a net label on a
schematic view. When you see a dotted line on a Rats Nest, you should think of
it as a _possible_ connection point, but not necessarily the final place where
the autorouter will connect to the net.
