## Overview

Light emitting diodes are [diodes](./diode.mdx) that emit light when current
passes through them. They are commonly used as indicators on a circuit board
such as a "power on indicator" or "data transfer in progress indicator".

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <led name="LED1" footprint="0603" color="red" />
  )
`}
/>

## Properties

| Property         | Example Value | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `color`          | `red`         | The color of the LED. `red` LEDs are most common.                |
| `forwardVoltage` | `1.6V`        | The voltage drop across the LED when forward current is applied. |

### Color Example

Here's an example showing how to use different LED colors in a board layout:

<CircuitPreview
  browser3d={false}
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <led name="D1" footprint="0402" color="red" pcbY={2} />
      <led name="D2" footprint="0603" color="green"/>
      <led name="D3" footprint="0805" color="blue" pcbY={-2}/>
    </board>
  )
`}
/>

### Common LED Footprints

The following represent the most common footprints for LEDs based on [jlcsearch](https://jlcsearch.tscircuit.com),
you can provide these as the `footprint` property to the `led` element e.g. `<led footprint="led0603" />`

| Footprint | ~JLCPCB Popularity |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| `led0603` | 37%                |
| `led0805` | 23%                |
| `led1206` | 10%                |
| `led0402` | 4%                 |

## Automatic Part Selection

LEDs are automatically selected according to their color and footprint using
the [platform parts engine](../guides/running-tscircuit/platform-configuration.md)
