## Overview

Light emitting diodes are [diodes](./diode.mdx) that emit light when current
passes through them. They are commonly used as indicators on a circuit board
such as a "power on indicator" or "data transfer in progress indicator".

## Properties

| Property         | Example Value | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `color`          | `red`         | The color of the LED. `red` LEDs are most common.                |
| `forwardVoltage` | `1.6V`        | The voltage drop across the LED when forward current is applied. |

### Common LED Footprints

The following represent the most common footprints for LEDs based on [jlcsearch](https://jlcsearch.tscircuit.com),
you can provide these as the `footprint` property to the `led` element e.g. `<led footprint="led0603" />`

| Footprint | ~JLCPCB Popularity |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| `led0603` | 37%                |
| `led0805` | 23%                |
| `led1206` | 10%                |
| `led0402` | 4%                 |

## Automatic Part Selection

LEDs are automatically selected according to their color and footprint using
the [platform parts engine](../guides/platform-configuration.md)
