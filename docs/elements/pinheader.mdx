  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`export default () => (
   <board width="30mm" height="10mm">
    <pinheader
      name="J1"
      pinCount={8}
      gender="male"
      pitch="2.54mm"
      doubleRow={true}
      showSilkscreenPinLabels={true}
      pinLabels={["VCC", "GND", "SDA", "SCL", "MISO", "MOSI", "SCK", "CS"]}
      x={10}
      y={10}
    />
   </board>
  )
`}
/>
