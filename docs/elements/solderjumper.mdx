description: Small pads that can be cut or bridged with solder for configuration options.

## Overview

A `<solderjumper />` is a tiny jumper made from exposed pads on the PCB. These pads can be bridged or cut to change the circuit after manufacturing. While a regular `<jumper />` usually uses a header-style footprint, solder jumpers are often just copper pads separated by a thin gap.

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <solderjumper name="SJ1" footprint="solderjumper2_bridged12" bridgedPins={[["1","2"]]} />
  )
  `}
/>

This snippet is based on the tests from [tscircuit/core](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/blob/main/tests/components/normal-components/solderjumper.test.tsx).

If you provide the `bridgedPins` property, tscircuit will create a small trace connecting those pins by default. You can cut the trace to open the connection or solder across the pads to reconnect them.

## Properties

The `<solderjumper />` component extends `<jumper />` with one additional property. From [`@tscircuit/props`](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/blob/main/lib/components/solderjumper.ts):

```ts
export interface SolderJumperProps extends JumperProps {
  /** Pins that are bridged with solder by default */
  bridgedPins?: string[][]
}
```

Use solder jumpers when you need a configuration option that can be easily changed with a soldering iron.
