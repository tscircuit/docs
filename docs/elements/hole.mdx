## Overview

A hole can be used for mounting and doesn't have any conductive properties, for
a hole with a conductive ring of copper see [`<platedhole />`](../footprints/platedhole.mdx).

Holes do not have a schematic representation.

Holes can be used inside of a [`<footprint />`](./footprint.mdx) or
as a standalone element.
