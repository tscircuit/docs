## Overview

A hole can be used for mounting and doesn't have any conductive properties, for
a hole with a conductive ring of copper see [`<platedhole />`](../footprints/platedhole.mdx).

Holes do not have a schematic representation.

Holes can be used inside of a [`<footprint />`](./footprint.mdx) or
as a standalone element.

## Hole Shapes

Two hole shapes are supported:

- `circle` - A circular hole (default)
- `pill` - A pill-shaped hole (rounded rectangle)

### Circle Hole

A circular hole is the most common type used for mounting:

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="3d"
  browser3dView={false}
  code={`export default () => (
    <board width="30mm" height="20mm">
      <hole diameter="3mm" x={10} y={10} />
    </board>
  )`}
/>

### Pill-Shaped Hole

Pill-shaped holes are useful for mounting components that need elongated holes or for allowing some positional adjustment:

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  browser3dView={false}
  code={`export default () => (
    <board width="30mm" height="20mm">
      <hole 
        shape="pill" 
        width="5mm" 
        height="2mm" 
        pcbX={0} 
        pcbY={0} 
      />
    </board>
  )`}
/>

### Rotated Pill Hole

Pill-shaped holes can be rotated using the `pcbRotation` property:

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  browser3dView={false}
  code={`export default () => (
    <board width="30mm" height="20mm">
      <hole 
        shape="pill" 
        width="5mm" 
        height="2mm" 
        pcbX={0} 
        pcbY={0}
        pcbRotation="45deg"
      />
    </board>
  )`}
/>
