## Overview

The `<cutout />` element removes material from a [`<board />`](./board.mdx)
outline. Use cutouts to add interior slots, mounting reliefs, wire passages, or
other custom shapes without editing the overall board outline.

Cutouts are fabricated along with the board outline, so you can preview them in
the PCB view and expect them to be milled or routed during manufacturing.

## Supported Shapes

The `shape` prop determines how the cutout is interpreted:

- `rect` (default) &mdash; remove a rectangular slot using `width` and `height`.
- `circle` &mdash; remove a circular opening using `radius` or `diameter`.
- `polygon` &mdash; remove a custom polygon defined by `points`.

All shapes support `pcbX` and `pcbY` to position the cutout relative to the
board's origin. Dimensions accept either numbers (treated as millimeters) or
strings like `"3mm"`.

## Examples

### Multiple Cutout Shapes on One Board

This board uses three different cutout shapes: a rectangular USB notch, a cable
pass-through circle, and a decorative polygon.

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`export default () => (
    <board width="30mm" height="20mm">
      <cutout shape="rect" width="5mm" height="3mm" pcbX="-10mm" pcbY="0mm" />
      <cutout shape="circle" radius="2mm" pcbX="0mm" pcbY="0mm" />
      <cutout
        shape="polygon"
        points={[
          { x: 5, y: -2 },
          { x: 8, y: 0 },
          { x: 5, y: 2 },
          { x: 6, y: 0 },
        ]}
        pcbX="5mm"
        pcbY="0mm"
      />
    </board>
  )`}
/>

### Rectangular Slot for Connectors

Rectangular cutouts are ideal for panel-mount connectors or finger slots. Width
and height define the opening size.

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`export default () => (
    <board width="25mm" height="18mm">
      <chip name="U1" footprint="soic8" pcbX={0} pcbY={0} />
      <cutout shape="rect" width="6mm" height="4mm" pcbX={-8} pcbY={0} />
    </board>
  )`}
/>

### Circular Cable Relief

Circular cutouts create pass-throughs for wires or alignment posts. Set either a
`radius` or `diameter` to size the opening.

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`export default () => (
    <board width="24mm" height="16mm">
      <cutout shape="circle" radius="1.5mm" pcbX={6} pcbY={-3} />
      <cutout shape="circle" radius="1.5mm" pcbX={6} pcbY={3} />
    </board>
  )`}
/>

### Custom Polygon Cutout

Pass an array of `{ x, y }` points to `points` for complex shapes. Points are
specified in millimeters relative to the cutout's local origin, which is then
positioned with `pcbX` and `pcbY`.

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`export default () => (
    <board width="28mm" height="22mm">
      <cutout
        shape="polygon"
        points={[
          { x: -4, y: -2 },
          { x: 4, y: -2 },
          { x: 6, y: 0 },
          { x: 4, y: 2 },
          { x: -4, y: 2 },
        ]}
        pcbX={0}
        pcbY={0}
      />
    </board>
  )`}
/>

## Tips

- Combine cutouts with [`<hole />`](./hole.mdx) elements when you need both
  clearance and mounting hardware on the same edge.
- Keep a small gap between cutouts and copper features to satisfy your
  manufacturerâ€™s mechanical clearance rules.
- When exporting fabrication files, cutouts appear on the board outline layer,
  so confirm your CAM output shows the expected openings before ordering.
