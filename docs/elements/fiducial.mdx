## Overview

A fiducial is a reference marker placed on a PCB that pick-and-place machines use for optical alignment during automated assembly. It consists of a circular copper pad with soldermask clearance (pullback) around it, creating a high-contrast marker that's easily detected by machine vision systems.

Fiducials do not have a schematic representation.

Fiducials are typically placed at corners of the board or near fine-pitch components to ensure accurate component placement.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| padDiameter | number \| string | - | Diameter of the copper pad (e.g., `"1mm"` or `1`) |
| soldermaskPullback | number \| string | padDiameter / 2 | Margin of soldermask clearance around the pad |
| pcbX | number | 0 | X position of the fiducial center on the PCB |
| pcbY | number | 0 | Y position of the fiducial center on the PCB |
| layer | `"top"` \| `"bottom"` | `"top"` | PCB layer for the fiducial |
