title: <jumper />
description: A simple connector that typically uses a pinrow footprint but can be used for custom layouts as well.
---

## Overview

A `<jumper />` represents a small multi-pin connector, commonly a male or female header using a `pinrow` style footprint. You can think of it as a flexible connector that can be placed anywhere on the board much like a `<chip />`.

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <jumper name="J1" footprint="pinrow4" />
    </board>
  )
  `}
/>

The example above is adapted from the [core tests](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/blob/main/tests/components/normal-components/jumper.test.tsx).

## Properties

`<jumper />` shares many of the common component properties such as `pcbX`, `pcbY` and `footprint`. The full TypeScript interface is defined in [`@tscircuit/props`](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/blob/main/lib/components/jumper.ts):

```ts
export interface JumperProps extends CommonComponentProps {
  manufacturerPartNumber?: string
  pinLabels?: Record<number | string, string | string[]>
  schPinStyle?: SchematicPinStyle
  schPinSpacing?: number | string
  schWidth?: number | string
  schHeight?: number | string
  schDirection?: "left" | "right"
  schPortArrangement?: SchematicPortArrangement
  /** Number of pins on the jumper (2 or 3) */
  pinCount?: 2 | 3
  /** Groups of pins that are internally connected */
  internallyConnectedPins?: string[][]
}
```

Jumpers are often placed using footprints such as `pinrow8` or `pinrow6_female_rows2`, but you can also provide a custom `<footprint />` just like with `<chip />`.
