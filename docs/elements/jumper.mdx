title: <jumper />
description: A simple connector that typically uses a pinrow footprint but can be used for custom layouts as well.
---

## Overview

A `<jumper />` represents a small multi-pin connector, commonly a male or female header using a `pinrow` style footprint. You can think of it as a flexible connector that can be placed anywhere on the board much like a `<chip />`.

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <jumper name="J1" footprint="pinrow4" />
    </board>
  )
  `}
/>

The example above is adapted from the [core tests](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/blob/main/tests/components/normal-components/jumper.test.tsx).

## Properties

`<jumper />` shares many of the common component properties such as `pcbX`, `pcbY` and `footprint`. The full TypeScript interface is defined in [`@tscircuit/props`](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/blob/main/lib/components/jumper.ts):

```ts
export interface JumperProps extends CommonComponentProps {
  manufacturerPartNumber?: string
  pinLabels?: Record<number | string, string | string[]>
  schPinStyle?: SchematicPinStyle
  schPinSpacing?: number | string
  schWidth?: number | string
  schHeight?: number | string
  schDirection?: "left" | "right"
  schPortArrangement?: SchematicPortArrangement
  /** Number of pins on the jumper (2 or 3) */
  pinCount?: 2 | 3
  /**
   * Groups of pins that are internally connected
   * e.g., [["1","2"], ["2","3"]]
   */
  internallyConnectedPins?: string[][]
}
```

Jumpers are often placed using footprints such as `pinrow8` or `pinrow6_female_rows2`, but you can also provide a custom `<footprint />` just like with `<chip />`.

### Internally Connected Pins

Use the `internallyConnectedPins` prop when the jumper has pins that should be shorted (bridged) together by default. Pins can be referenced by their labels.

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <jumper
        name="J2"
        footprint="pinrow3"
        pinCount={3}
        pinLabels={{ 1: "A", 2: "B", 3: "C" }}
        internallyConnectedPins={[["A", "B"], ["B", "C"]]}
      />
    </board>
  )
  `}
/>

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `pinCount` | `2` \| `3` | Number of pins on the jumper |
| `internallyConnectedPins` | `string[][]` | Groups of pins that are internally connected |
| `manufacturerPartNumber` | `string` | Manufacturer part number |
| `pinLabels` | `Record<number \| string, string \| string[]>` | Labels for pins or sets of pins |
| `schPinStyle` | `SchematicPinStyle` | Style used for pins in the schematic |
| `schPinSpacing` | `number` \| `string` | Spacing between schematic pins |
| `schWidth` | `number` \| `string` | Width of the schematic symbol |
| `schHeight` | `number` \| `string` | Height of the schematic symbol |
| `schDirection` | `"left"` \| `"right"` | Direction the jumper faces in the schematic |
| `schPortArrangement` | `SchematicPortArrangement` | Arrangement of ports in the schematic |
