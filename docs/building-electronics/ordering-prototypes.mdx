## Overview

After [you've designed your device](./designing-electronics-from-scratch.md),
you can use [fabrication files](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md)
to get your device fully assembled.

The two most popular services for
ordering prototypes are [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and [PCBWay](https://pcbway.com).

## Ordering Through tscircuit Platform

The easiest way to order your prototypes is through the tscircuit platform, which handles the entire ordering process for you. Here's how it works:

### 1. Get Order Quotes

Navigate to the view packages page where you'll find the order button for your circuit.

### 2. Select Your Vendor and Quote

When you click the order button, a dialog will appear showing quotes from different vendors. Currently, JLCPCB is the only available vendor, with more vendors coming soon. Compare the prices, lead times, and shipping options, then select your preferred vendor and click continue.

### 3. Complete Your Order

Finally, you'll be redirected to a secure Stripe checkout page where you can enter your payment details and shipping address. Your PCB will be delivered directly to your specified address.

## Uploading [Fabrication Files](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md)

Most fabrication or turn-key assembly services allow you to directly upload 3 types of files:

- Gerbers
- Bill of Materials (BOM CSV)
- Pick'n'Place File (CSV)

These files are all available inside your [Fabrication Files zip file](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md) when
you export from tscircuit.

## Assembling your own boards

It can sometimes be easier to assemble your own boards, this gives you more
control over your inventory and can lower the cost of your prototypes since
assembly services often have a minimum order quantity.

Even if you're assembling your own board, you should still order your PCB
from a fabrication service. PCBs require a chemical etching process to do
at home and it's rarely worth the hassle to do it yourself.

When you're assembling your own board, you can create a printout of your
Assembly View to make it easier to place components. In an assembly view,
the "pin1" location is marked with a cut corner. This can help you verify
the orientation of each component as you place it.
