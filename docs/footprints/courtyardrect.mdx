## Overview

Courtyard rectangles define the physical boundary of a component, including potential tolerance. They are critical for ensuring components are not placed too close together.

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" hideSchematicTab hide3DTab code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="20mm" height="20mm">
      <courtyardrect width={2} height={3} />
      <courtyardrect width={4} height={1} pcbX={5} layer="bottom" />
    </board>
  )
`} />
