## Overview

The `<smtpad />` element is used to represent a surface mount pad.

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <chip name="U1" footprint={
        <footprint>
          <smtpad
            pcbX="0mm"
            pcbY="0mm"
            layer="top"
            shape="rect"
            width="5mm"
            height="5mm"

## SMT Pad Shapes

There are 3 main types of smtpads:

- `rect` - A rectangular pad
- `circle` - A circular pad
- `pill` - A pill-shaped pad

Each smtpad shape has different properties

## Properties

| Property    | Shape        | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| width       | rect, pill   | The width of the pad                                           |
| height      | rect, pill   | The height of the pad                                          |
| radius      | circle, pill | The radius of the pad (for circle) or corner radius (for pill) |
| ccwRotation | rect         | Counter-clockwise rotation angle in degrees                    |
| portHints   | all          | Array of port names that this pad connects to                  |
| pcbX        | all          | X position of the pad center on the PCB                        |
| pcbY        | all          | Y position of the pad center on the PCB                        |
| layer       | all          | Which layer the pad is on ("top" or "bottom")                  |
