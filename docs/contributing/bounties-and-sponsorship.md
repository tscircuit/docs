title: Bounties and Sponsorship
---

tscircuit has thousands of dollars (USD) of bounties opened every month in over
50 new weekly issues. We also automatically sponsor regular contributors
hundreds of dollars each based on their contributions. All of this activity is
tracked in the open-source
[contribution-tracker](https://github.com/tscircuit/contribution-tracker),
which powers [contributions.tscircuit.com](https://contributions.tscircuit.com)
and resets every Wednesday.

## How the contribution tracker works

- Every PR across the tscircuit GitHub org is scanned and summarized via an LLM
  so we can consistently understand the scope of each change.
- The LLM classifies each diff/PR into attributes such as **üê≥ Major**,
  **üêô Minor**, and **üêå Tiny** impact levels and assigns a star rating that feeds
  the weekly score shown on the sponsorship leaderboard.
- The resulting data is organized into the sections you see on the tracker‚Äîsuch
  as Contributor Overview, PRs by Repository, and PRs by Contributor‚Äîso you can
  quickly understand where impactful work is happening across the ecosystem.
- Historical exports, including weekly contribution overviews and AI-generated
  monthly changelogs, are kept directly in the
  [contribution-tracker repo](https://github.com/tscircuit/contribution-tracker)
  if you want to dig deeper into past activity.

Many people follow the [bounties channel on discord](https://discord.com/channels/1233487248129921135/1301957862762872832) or our [bounty board](https://console.algora.io/org/tscircuit/bounties?status=open)
to find issues to contribute to, but **this is actually the hardest way to get bounties!**

:::tip

You can quickly find issues (with or without bounties) by [spinning the wheel of issues](https://issues.tscircuit.com/)

:::

**The easiest way to get bounties and sponsorship is to _actually use tscircuit and try to build a circuit_.** When you
find something confusing or buggy, create an issue. When you create an issue that
gets bountied, you get extra points on the contribution tracker and you become
the best person to fix the issue because you understand it so well! If you
continually do this, you'll find that there are infinite issues to be done!

## How sponsorship amounts are calculated

Sponsorship payouts are based on the last four weeks of star ratings captured by
the tracker. The algorithm takes the median, minimum, and maximum weekly star
counts to decide on a base amount‚Äîranging from $15 for occasional stars up to
$500 for consistently high-impact weeks‚Äîwith a $5 safety net for anyone whose
historical high score stays above 3. You can read the current logic directly in
[`getSponsorshipAmount.ts`](https://github.com/tscircuit/contribution-tracker/blob/main/lib/scoring/getSponsorshipAmount.ts)
for the exact thresholds.

Maintainers receive an additional fixed monthly sponsorship on top of the weekly
calculation so their support stays stable. Those maintainer bonuses are defined
alongside the algorithm in the tracker codebase.

To be eligible for Github Sponsorship, you must be in a supported country and
have Github Sponsors enabled on your Github profile.
