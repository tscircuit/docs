We have some important patterns that make contributing to
tscircuit more consistent, we document these in [our handbook repo](https://github.com/tscircuit/handbook).

Here are a couple of really important ones:

1. [Use Yalc](https://github.com/tscircuit/handbook/blob/main/guides/using-yalc.md) - tscircuit uses many repositories so it can be hard to test different repositories interacting.
2. [Code Styles](https://github.com/tscircuit/handbook/blob/main/guides/code.md) - tscircuit has some consistent code patterns we use in every project. This makes the code more universally understood. Definitely note the banned words section!
