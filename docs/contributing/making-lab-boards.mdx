The tscircuit lab features a Commarker Omni X UV Laser capable of ablating copper
clad.

The standard copper clad in the lab is single-sided at 100mmx70mm. You should
generally try to use the entire board to make post-processing simpler.

  <board width="100mm" height="70mm" />
)
`} />

We maintain a [lab inventory full of components](https://links.tscircuit.com/),
please prefer to use stocked components.

Our standard lab process involves ablating copper clad, applying a Solder Mask
to the entire board, curing mask, then ablating the exposed pads (laser off the
negative solder mask layer). We then apply solder paste manually and assemble on
a hot plate.
