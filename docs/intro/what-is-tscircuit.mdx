tscircuit is an open-source React/Typescript electronics toolchain and ecosystem
for creating, previewing, simulating and manufacturing Printed Circuit Boards
(PCBs).

React and Typescript are standard tools that revolutionized the web development
ecosystem. tscircuit combines the powerful static analysis of Typescript with
the modular component system of React to make developing electronics faster,
easier and more automated. To generate tscircuit with AI chat, check out our
[AI context](../advanced/ai-context.mdx)

Here's an example of a basic tscircuit electronic device, it's the USB
flashlight that we make in [this tutorial](../tutorials/building-a-simple-usb-flashlight.mdx).

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview defaultView="3d" code={`
import { PushButton } from "@tsci/seveibar.push-button"
import { SmdUsbC } from "@tsci/seveibar.smd-usb-c"

export default () => {
  return (
    <board width="12mm" height="30mm">
      <SmdUsbC
        name="J1"
        connections={{
          GND1: "net.GND",
          GND2: "net.GND",
          VBUS1: "net.VBUS",
          VBUS2: "net.VBUS",
        }}
        pcbY={-10.5}
      />
      <led
        name="LED"
        supplierPartNumbers={{
          jlcpcb: ["965799"],
        }}
        color="red"
        footprint="0603"
        pcbY={12}
      />
      <pushbutton
        name="SW1"
        pcbRotation="90deg"
        footprint="pushbutton_id1.3mm_od2mm"
        connections={{ pin1: ".R1 > .pos", pin2: "net.VBUS" }}
        supplierPartNumbers={{
          jlcpcb: ["C110153"],
        }}
      />
      <resistor name="R1" footprint="0603" resistance="1k" pcbY={7} />

      <trace from="R1.neg" to="LED.pos" />
      <trace from="LED.neg" to="net.GND" />
    </board>
  )
}
`} />

This small snippet of code helps demonstrate the power of tscircuit. From those
40 lines, we were able to create a full PCB, Schematic and 3D preview. Not only
that, but we can export this circuit to [Fabrication Files](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files)
and get it fabricated and assembled. In fact we did!

import usbcflashlight from "@site/static/img/usbcflashlight_20250123_1816894.jpg"

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginBottom: 18 }}>
<img style={{maxWidth: 400}} src={usbcflashlight} alt="USB Flashlight PCB After Manufacturing" />
</div>

It may not seem like much, but tscircuit just handled a _lot_ of work for us!

- Automatic Part Selection and Bill of Materials Generation
- Autorouting
- Schematic and PCB Layout
- 3D Model Generation
- Fabrication File Generation

...and it ran completely in our browser!

tscircuit isn't limited to simple circuits like this. You can keep adding
elements, creating modules and combining them to create more and more complex
circuits. Here's an example of a [simple 3x3 macrokeypad based on the PICO2!](https://tscircuit.com/seveibar/nine-key-keyboard)

We ordered this one too!

import macrokeypad from "@site/static/img/macrokeypad.png"

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginBottom: 24 }}>
<img style={{maxHeight: 400}} src={macrokeypad} alt="3x3 Macrokeypad" />
</div>
