You can use tscircuit online without installing anything on [tscircuit.com](https://tscircuit.com)!

## Using the Online Editor

The [tscircuit online editor](https://tscircuit.com/editor) is a full Typescript editor with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, type-checking and tools for importing snippets and configuring chips.

There are two types of projects you can create in the online editor.

- **board**: a fully-functional electronic device that you can order
- **module**: a reusable component, usually a specific chip or subcircuit, that you can use across many boards or to break up a complex board into smaller, more manageable pieces.

To get started, let's create a simple board.

You can use the "New" button on [tscircuit.com](https://tscircuit.com) and select
"board" to open the editor with a blank board:

The editor will open with a template board that looks like this:

<img className="img-rounded img-400" src="/img/editor-with-template-board-3d.png" />

You can now edit the board by adding or removing elements! Check out the
[essential elements guide](../guides/essential-elements.mdx) to learn more about
the available elements. If you've already got an idea of what you want to build,
try breaking down the problem into modules using our [designing electronics from scratch guide](../building-electronics/designing-electronics-from-scratch.md)

After you make a change, click the "Run" button to see your changes applied. You
can use the PCB, Schematic, and 3D views to make sure everything is correctly
aligned.

When you're ready to manufacture your board, click the "Download" button to
download [fabrication files.](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md)

When you're ready to order your board, check out the [ordering prototypes guide](../building-electronics/ordering-prototypes.md). You can
electronics fully assembled and ready to use from the many services that accept
our standard fabrication files.

## Using the AI Assistant

Our AI assistant is available in beta but is undergoing a big overhaul. We'll update this section when we're happy with it!
