title: Simple Route JSON
---

## Overview

Simple Route JSON (SRJ) is a lightweight, straightforward format designed to describe a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) routing problem. It serves as a common intermediary representation used by [`tscircuit` autorouters](https://github.com/tscircuit/unravel-autorouter), simplifying the complex details often found in full PCB design files.

The primary goal of SRJ is to provide only the essential information required for a routing algorithm:
1.  Where routing is allowed (layers, board boundaries).
2.  Where routing is forbidden (obstacles, keep-out areas).
3.  What needs to be connected (nets and their associated pins/pads).
4.  Basic routing constraints (minimum trace width).

SRJ can be directly generated from more comprehensive formats like [Circuit JSON](https://circuitjson.com), stripping away details irrelevant to the core routing task (e.g., specific component models, schematic information beyond connectivity). It shares conceptual similarities with the industry-standard [Specctra DSN (Design)](https://github.com/tscircuit/dsn-converter) format, but aims for greater simplicity and modern JSON representation.

## Format Structure

A Simple Route JSON file is a single JSON object containing the definition of the board layout, obstacles, and connections needed for routing.

```typescript
export interface SimpleRouteJson {
  /** The total number of conductive layers on the PCB. */
  layerCount: number;

  /** The default or minimum width for traces. Specific trace segments might override this if the format evolves, but currently used as a general guideline. Units are implicit (e.g., mm, inches) and must be consistent throughout the file. */
  minTraceWidth: number;

  /** An array of obstacles on the board, such as component pads, mounting holes, or keep-out areas. */
  obstacles: Obstacle[];

  /** An array defining the electrical connections (nets) that need to be routed. */
  connections: Array<SimpleRouteConnection>;

  /** The bounding box defining the extents of the routing area. */
  bounds: { minX: number; maxX: number; minY: number; maxY: number };

  /** [Optional] The routing solution provided by an autorouter. This array contains the actual paths of the traces. It is typically absent in the input file given to a router and present in the output file. */
  traces?: SimplifiedPcbTrace[];
}
```

## Top-Level Properties

### `layerCount`

*   **Type:** `number`
*   **Description:** An integer specifying the total number of conductive layers available for routing on the PCB. Layers are typically identified by string names (e.g., `"top"`, `"inner1"`, `"bottom"`) within other parts of the format (like `obstacles` and `connections`). While `layerCount` provides the total number, the specific layer names used must be consistent throughout the file.

### `minTraceWidth`

*   **Type:** `number`
*   **Description:** Specifies the default or minimum trace width to be used by the autorouter. This acts as a global constraint. Future versions or specific router implementations might allow per-net or per-segment width rules, but this provides a baseline.
*   **Units:** Units (e.g., millimeters, inches) are not explicitly defined by the format. It is crucial that the same unit system is used consistently for all dimensional values (`minTraceWidth`, `obstacles`, `bounds`, coordinates) within a single SRJ file. Millimeters (mm) are commonly used.

### `obstacles`

*   **Type:** `Array<Obstacle>`
*   **Description:** An array containing objects that represent areas on the PCB where routing is either restricted or represents a connection point. Obstacles can be physical component pads, mounting holes, board edges defined as keep-outs, or explicit keep-out zones.

```typescript
export type Obstacle = {
  /** The shape of the obstacle. Currently, only "rect" is standard. Oval shapes might be included in future revisions. */
  type: "rect"; // NOTE: most datasets do not contain ovals

  /** An array of layer names (strings) on which this obstacle exists. An obstacle can span multiple layers (e.g., a plated through-hole pad). */
  layers: string[];

  /** The center coordinates of the obstacle. */
  center: { x: number; y: number };

  /** The width of the rectangular obstacle. */
  width: number;

  /** The height of the rectangular obstacle. */
  height: number;

  /** An array of connection names (strings) that this obstacle is part of. If this obstacle is a pad for a net (e.g., "GND", "VCC"), the net name(s) will be listed here. If the array is empty, the obstacle is typically a keep-out area or an unconnected feature. */
  connectedTo: string[];
};
```
*   **`type`**: Defines the geometry. Currently `"rect"` is the standard.
*   **`layers`**: Specifies which layer(s) the obstacle occupies. Important for multi-layer routing.
*   **`center`, `width`, `height`**: Define the geometry and position of the rectangle. Units must be consistent with `minTraceWidth` and `bounds`.
*   **`connectedTo`**: This critical field links obstacles (like pads) to the electrical nets defined in the `connections` array. If an obstacle represents a pin for the "VCC" net, `connectedTo` would contain `["VCC"]`.

### `connections`

*   **Type:** `Array<SimpleRouteConnection>`
*   **Description:** Defines the sets of points that need to be electrically connected. Each object in the array represents a single net (e.g., power, ground, signal).

```typescript
export interface SimpleRouteConnection {
  /** The unique name of the connection or net (e.g., "GND", "VCC", "DATA0"). This name is referenced by Obstacle.connectedTo. */
  name: string;

  /** An array of points that must be connected together to form this net. Each point typically corresponds to the center of an obstacle (pad) belonging to this net. */
  pointsToConnect: Array<{
    /** The x-coordinate of the connection point. */
    x: number;
    /** The y-coordinate of the connection point. */
    y: number;
    /** The layer name (string) on which this connection point resides. */
    layer: string;
  }>;
}
```
*   **`name`**: A unique string identifier for the net. This is used to link `Obstacle` objects (pads) to their respective nets.
*   **`pointsToConnect`**: An array listing the specific locations (`x`, `y`, `layer`) that the router must connect. These points usually align with the `center` coordinates and `layers` of the corresponding `Obstacle` objects linked via the `name`.

### `bounds`

*   **Type:** `object`
*   **Description:** Defines the rectangular boundary of the area where routing is permitted. Traces should generally not extend beyond these limits.
*   **Structure:**
    *   `minX`: The minimum x-coordinate of the routing area.
    *   `maxX`: The maximum x-coordinate of the routing area.
    *   `minY`: The minimum y-coordinate of the routing area.
    *   `maxY`: The maximum y-coordinate of the routing area.
*   **Units:** Must be consistent with other dimensional values in the file.

### `traces` (Optional)

*   **Type:** `Array<SimplifiedPcbTrace>`
*   **Description:** This array represents the output of an autorouter – the actual geometric paths (traces and vias) that implement the required connections. It is typically **not present** in the input SRJ file given to the router.
*   **Presence:** Included in the SRJ file *after* routing has been successfully completed.

```typescript
export type SimplifiedPcbTrace = {
  /** Identifier indicating the object type. Always "pcb_trace". */
  type: "pcb_trace";

  /** A unique identifier for this specific trace path. */
  pcb_trace_id: string;

  /** [Optional] The name of the connection/net this trace belongs to. Links the solved route back to the SimpleRouteConnection definition. */
  connection_name?: string;

  /** An array defining the geometry of the trace path, composed of wire segments and vias. */
  route: Array<
    | {
        /** Indicates a straight wire segment on a single layer. */
        route_type: "wire";
        /** The x-coordinate of the *end* point of the wire segment. */
        x: number;
        /** The y-coordinate of the *end* point of the wire segment. */
        y: number;
        /** The width of this wire segment. */
        width: number;
        /** The layer name (string) this wire segment is on. */
        layer: string;
      }
    | {
        /** Indicates a via connecting two layers. */
        route_type: "via";
        /** The x-coordinate of the via's center. */
        x: number;
        /** The y-coordinate of the via's center. */
        y: number;
        /** The layer name (string) the via transitions *to*. */
        to_layer: string;
        /** The layer name (string) the via transitions *from*. */
        from_layer: string;
      }
  >;
};
```
*   **`type`**: Always `"pcb_trace"`.
*   **`pcb_trace_id`**: Unique ID for the trace.
*   **`connection_name`**: Links trace to the net name from `connections`.
*   **`route`**: An ordered array describing the path:
    *   **`wire`**: Represents a straight segment of copper trace. The segment runs from the end point of the previous element in the `route` array (or an initial connection point) to the specified `(x, y)` coordinate on the given `layer` with the specified `width`.
    *   **`via`**: Represents a vertical connection between layers at `(x, y)`, transitioning from `from_layer` to `to_layer`. Note that physical via characteristics (drill size, annular ring) are not detailed in this simplified format.

      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Units and Coordinate System

The Simple Route JSON format does **not** enforce specific units (e.g., mm, mil, inches) or a coordinate system origin (e.g., top-left, bottom-left).

*   **Consistency is Key:** All dimensional values (`minTraceWidth`, obstacle `width`/`height`, `bounds`, all `x`/`y` coordinates in `obstacles`, `connections`, and `traces`) within a single SRJ file **must** use the same units.
*   **Common Practice:** Millimeters (mm) are frequently used.
*   **Origin:** The coordinate system origin is typically assumed to be top-left or bottom-left, with X increasing to the right and Y increasing downwards (top-left) or upwards (bottom-left). Consistency within the file and between the SRJ generator and consumer (the autorouter) is essential.

## Relationship to Other Formats

*   **Circuit JSON:** Simple Route JSON is a simplified derivative of Circuit JSON. Tools can convert Circuit JSON to SRJ by extracting layer stackup information, component pad locations and net assignments, board outlines, and any defined keep-out areas. Information not relevant to routing (e.g., schematic IDs, component values, 3D models) is omitted.
*   **Specctra DSN:** SRJ serves a similar purpose to DSN files – describing a routing problem. However, SRJ uses a modern JSON structure, which is often easier to parse and generate in web-based and JavaScript/TypeScript environments compared to the text-based, keyword-driven DSN format. The `dsn-converter` tool ([link](https://github.com/tscircuit/dsn-converter)) can facilitate conversion between DSN and SRJ or similar formats.

## Usage

The primary use case for Simple Route JSON is as the input and output format for `tscircuit` autorouting tools.

1.  **Input:** A PCB design tool or conversion script generates an SRJ file describing the board, obstacles, and connections. This file is fed into an autorouter.
2.  **Output:** The autorouter processes the input SRJ, computes the trace paths, and outputs a new SRJ file that includes the original data plus the `traces` array detailing the solution.
3.  **Post-processing:** The output SRJ (with traces) can then be converted back into a format compatible with PCB design software (like Circuit JSON, KiCad, Eagle, etc.) to integrate the routing solution into the full PCB design.

## Format Structure

A Simple Route JSON file is a single JSON object containing the definition of the board layout, obstacles, and connections needed for routing.

```typescript
export interface SimpleRouteJson {
  /** The total number of conductive layers on the PCB. */
  layerCount: number;

  /** The default or minimum width for traces. Specific trace segments might override this if the format evolves, but currently used as a general guideline. Units are implicit (e.g., mm, inches) and must be consistent throughout the file. */
  minTraceWidth: number;

  /** An array of obstacles on the board, such as component pads, mounting holes, or keep-out areas. */
  obstacles: Obstacle[];

  /** An array defining the electrical connections (nets) that need to be routed. */
  connections: Array<SimpleRouteConnection>;

  /** The bounding box defining the extents of the routing area. */
  bounds: { minX: number; maxX: number; minY: number; maxY: number };

  /** [Optional] The routing solution provided by an autorouter. This array contains the actual paths of the traces. It is typically absent in the input file given to a router and present in the output file. */
  traces?: SimplifiedPcbTrace[];
}
```

## Top-Level Properties

### `layerCount`

*   **Type:** `number`
*   **Description:** An integer specifying the total number of conductive layers available for routing on the PCB. Layers are typically identified by string names (e.g., `"top"`, `"inner1"`, `"bottom"`) within other parts of the format (like `obstacles` and `connections`). While `layerCount` provides the total number, the specific layer names used must be consistent throughout the file.

### `minTraceWidth`

*   **Type:** `number`
*   **Description:** Specifies the default or minimum trace width to be used by the autorouter. This acts as a global constraint. Future versions or specific router implementations might allow per-net or per-segment width rules, but this provides a baseline.
*   **Units:** Units (e.g., millimeters, inches) are not explicitly defined by the format. It is crucial that the same unit system is used consistently for all dimensional values (`minTraceWidth`, `obstacles`, `bounds`, coordinates) within a single SRJ file. Millimeters (mm) are commonly used.

### `obstacles`

*   **Type:** `Array<Obstacle>`
*   **Description:** An array containing objects that represent areas on the PCB where routing is either restricted or represents a connection point. Obstacles can be physical component pads, mounting holes, board edges defined as keep-outs, or explicit keep-out zones.

```typescript
export type Obstacle = {
  /** The shape of the obstacle. Currently, only "rect" is standard. Oval shapes might be included in future revisions. */
  type: "rect"; // NOTE: most datasets do not contain ovals

  /** An array of layer names (strings) on which this obstacle exists. An obstacle can span multiple layers (e.g., a plated through-hole pad). */
  layers: string[];

  /** The center coordinates of the obstacle. */
  center: { x: number; y: number };

  /** The width of the rectangular obstacle. */
  width: number;

  /** The height of the rectangular obstacle. */
  height: number;

  /** An array of connection names (strings) that this obstacle is part of. If this obstacle is a pad for a net (e.g., "GND", "VCC"), the net name(s) will be listed here. If the array is empty, the obstacle is typically a keep-out area or an unconnected feature. */
  connectedTo: string[];
};
```
*   **`type`**: Defines the geometry. Currently `"rect"` is the standard.
*   **`layers`**: Specifies which layer(s) the obstacle occupies. Important for multi-layer routing.
*   **`center`, `width`, `height`**: Define the geometry and position of the rectangle. Units must be consistent with `minTraceWidth` and `bounds`.
*   **`connectedTo`**: This critical field links obstacles (like pads) to the electrical nets defined in the `connections` array. If an obstacle represents a pin for the "VCC" net, `connectedTo` would contain `["VCC"]`.

### `connections`

*   **Type:** `Array<SimpleRouteConnection>`
*   **Description:** Defines the sets of points that need to be electrically connected. Each object in the array represents a single net (e.g., power, ground, signal).

```typescript
export interface SimpleRouteConnection {
  /** The unique name of the connection or net (e.g., "GND", "VCC", "DATA0"). This name is referenced by Obstacle.connectedTo. */
  name: string;

  /** An array of points that must be connected together to form this net. Each point typically corresponds to the center of an obstacle (pad) belonging to this net. */
  pointsToConnect: Array<{
    /** The x-coordinate of the connection point. */
    x: number;
    /** The y-coordinate of the connection point. */
    y: number;
    /** The layer name (string) on which this connection point resides. */
    layer: string;
  }>;
}
```
*   **`name`**: A unique string identifier for the net. This is used to link `Obstacle` objects (pads) to their respective nets.
*   **`pointsToConnect`**: An array listing the specific locations (`x`, `y`, `layer`) that the router must connect. These points usually align with the `center` coordinates and `layers` of the corresponding `Obstacle` objects linked via the `name`.

### `bounds`

*   **Type:** `object`
*   **Description:** Defines the rectangular boundary of the area where routing is permitted. Traces should generally not extend beyond these limits.
*   **Structure:**
    *   `minX`: The minimum x-coordinate of the routing area.
    *   `maxX`: The maximum x-coordinate of the routing area.
    *   `minY`: The minimum y-coordinate of the routing area.
    *   `maxY`: The maximum y-coordinate of the routing area.
*   **Units:** Must be consistent with other dimensional values in the file.

### `traces` (Optional)

*   **Type:** `Array<SimplifiedPcbTrace>`
*   **Description:** This array represents the output of an autorouter – the actual geometric paths (traces and vias) that implement the required connections. It is typically **not present** in the input SRJ file given to the router.
*   **Presence:** Included in the SRJ file *after* routing has been successfully completed.

```typescript
export type SimplifiedPcbTrace = {
  /** Identifier indicating the object type. Always "pcb_trace". */
  type: "pcb_trace";

  /** A unique identifier for this specific trace path. */
  pcb_trace_id: string;

  /** [Optional] The name of the connection/net this trace belongs to. Links the solved route back to the SimpleRouteConnection definition. */
  connection_name?: string;

  /** An array defining the geometry of the trace path, composed of wire segments and vias. */
  route: Array<
    | {
        /** Indicates a straight wire segment on a single layer. */
        route_type: "wire";
        /** The x-coordinate of the *end* point of the wire segment. */
        x: number;
        /** The y-coordinate of the *end* point of the wire segment. */
        y: number;
        /** The width of this wire segment. */
        width: number;
        /** The layer name (string) this wire segment is on. */
        layer: string;
      }
    | {
        /** Indicates a via connecting two layers. */
        route_type: "via";
        /** The x-coordinate of the via's center. */
        x: number;
        /** The y-coordinate of the via's center. */
        y: number;
        /** The layer name (string) the via transitions *to*. */
        to_layer: string;
        /** The layer name (string) the via transitions *from*. */
        from_layer: string;
      }
  >;
};
```
*   **`type`**: Always `"pcb_trace"`.
*   **`pcb_trace_id`**: Unique ID for the trace.
*   **`connection_name`**: Links trace to the net name from `connections`.
*   **`route`**: An ordered array describing the path:
    *   **`wire`**: Represents a straight segment of copper trace. The segment runs from the end point of the previous element in the `route` array (or an initial connection point) to the specified `(x, y)` coordinate on the given `layer` with the specified `width`.
    *   **`via`**: Represents a vertical connection between layers at `(x, y)`, transitioning from `from_layer` to `to_layer`. Note that physical via characteristics (drill size, annular ring) are not detailed in this simplified format.

## Units and Coordinate System

The Simple Route JSON format does **not** enforce specific units (e.g., mm, mil, inches) or a coordinate system origin (e.g., top-left, bottom-left).

*   **Consistency is Key:** All dimensional values (`minTraceWidth`, obstacle `width`/`height`, `bounds`, all `x`/`y` coordinates in `obstacles`, `connections`, and `traces`) within a single SRJ file **must** use the same units.
*   **Common Practice:** Millimeters (mm) are frequently used.
*   **Origin:** The coordinate system origin is typically assumed to be top-left or bottom-left, with X increasing to the right and Y increasing downwards (top-left) or upwards (bottom-left). Consistency within the file and between the SRJ generator and consumer (the autorouter) is essential.

## Relationship to Other Formats

*   **Circuit JSON:** Simple Route JSON is a simplified derivative of Circuit JSON. Tools can convert Circuit JSON to SRJ by extracting layer stackup information, component pad locations and net assignments, board outlines, and any defined keep-out areas. Information not relevant to routing (e.g., schematic IDs, component values, 3D models) is omitted.
*   **Specctra DSN:** SRJ serves a similar purpose to DSN files – describing a routing problem. However, SRJ uses a modern JSON structure, which is often easier to parse and generate in web-based and JavaScript/TypeScript environments compared to the text-based, keyword-driven DSN format. The `dsn-converter` tool ([link](https://github.com/tscircuit/dsn-converter)) can facilitate conversion between DSN and SRJ or similar formats.

## Usage

The primary use case for Simple Route JSON is as the input and output format for `tscircuit` autorouting tools.

1.  **Input:** A PCB design tool or conversion script generates an SRJ file describing the board, obstacles, and connections. This file is fed into an autorouter.
2.  **Output:** The autorouter processes the input SRJ, computes the trace paths, and outputs a new SRJ file that includes the original data plus the `traces` array detailing the solution.
3.  **Post-processing:** The output SRJ (with traces) can then be converted back into a format compatible with PCB design software (like Circuit JSON, KiCad, Eagle, etc.) to integrate the routing solution into the full PCB design.
