## Overview

This expanded tutorial walks through building a tiny USB-powered flashlight PCB using `tscircuit` components and a USB-C SMD connector.

## Objectives

- Build a compact USB-powered flashlight using a USB-C connector, a single LED and a pushbutton.
- Learn how to map connector pins to nets using the `connections` prop.
- Verify schematic and PCB preview before ordering.

## Parts & Tools

- 1 × USB-C SMD connector (4-pin) — used for VBUS + GND
- 1 × 0603 LED (choose color) — `LED`
- 1 × 0603 resistor 1k — `R1`
- 1 × SMD pushbutton — `SW1`
- Soldering iron, flux, solder, tweezers, multimeter

For a larger example of LED wiring and controller usage, see the [3x5 LED matrix tutorial](../tutorials/building-led-matrix.mdx).

## Circuit explanation

- The USB-C footprint exposes `VBUS` (5V) and GND pins.
- `R1` limits current from `VBUS` into `LED.pos` when `SW1` is pressed.
- `LED.neg` returns to `net.GND`.

## Step-by-step

1. Inspect the preview above to ensure `SmdUsbC` is mapped to `net.VBUS` and `net.GND` via `connections`.
2. Place components in the schematic and align footprints on the PCB view.
3. Use the 3D preview to confirm mechanical clearance for the USB connector.
4. Generate fabrication files and Gerbers using the export tools in the tscircuit toolchain.
5. Order PCBs and assemble; test with a multimeter and a current-limited bench supply if available.

## PCB tips

- Keep the USB connector mounting pads strong — use recommended footprint from manufacturer.
- Place a small fillet or bevel at the board edge to reduce stress on the connector.

## Testing

- With no load, verify `VBUS` reads ~5V between `VBUS` and `GND` at the connector.
- Press `SW1` and verify voltage at `LED.pos` drops per expected LED forward voltage.
- If LED does not light, confirm polarity and continuity through `R1`.

## Troubleshooting

- No power: check that the connector footprint actually exposes VBUS pins in the correct orientation.
- LED dim or not lit: swapped LED pads or wrong resistor value.

## Next steps

- Add an LED driver or MOSFET for brighter LEDs
- Add a simple charge controller and battery for a rechargeable flashlight
