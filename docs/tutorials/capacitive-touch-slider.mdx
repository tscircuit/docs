## Overview

A capacitive touch slider is a PCB-based input element that detects finger
position along a row of conductive pads. Unlike mechanical potentiometers,
capacitive sliders have no moving parts â€” making them durable and
moisture-resistant.

You'll find them in volume controls, brightness sliders, and consumer electronics.

In this tutorial, we'll build a 5-pad capacitive touch slider using tscircuit's
polygon smtpads with `coveredWithSolderMask` for a protected touch surface.

import TscircuitIframe from "@site/src/components/TscircuitIframe"

## The Complete Slider

<TscircuitIframe defaultView="pcb" code={`

export default () => {
  const padCount = 5
  const padWidth = 5  // mm
  const padHeight = 6 // mm
  const spacing = 8   // mm center-to-center (5mm pad + 3mm gap)
  const startX = -((padCount - 1) * spacing) / 2

  return (
    <board width="55mm" height="20mm">
      {Array.from({ length: padCount }, (_, i) => (
        <chip
          key={\`PAD\${i + 1}\`}
          name={\`PAD\${i + 1}\`}
          pcbX={startX + i * spacing}
          pcbY={0}
          footprint={
            <footprint>
              <smtpad
                shape="polygon"
                points={[
                  { x: 0, y: -padHeight / 2 },
                  { x: padWidth, y: -padHeight / 2 },
                  { x: padWidth, y: padHeight / 2 },
                  { x: 0, y: padHeight / 2 },
                ]}
                portHints={["1"]}
                coveredWithSolderMask
              />
            </footprint>
          }
        />
      ))}
    </board>
  )
}
`} />

## How It Works

### Capacitive Sensing

Each touch pad has a baseline capacitance. When your finger approaches,
it increases the capacitance â€” a microcontroller (like the CAP1188 or MPR121)
detects this change. With multiple adjacent pads, the controller interpolates
your finger's exact position along the slider.

### Why Polygon SMT Pads?

tscircuit's `<smtpad>` component supports custom polygon shapes, which gives
you full control over the pad geometry:

```tsx
<smtpad
  shape="polygon"
  points={[
    { x: 0, y: -3 },
    { x: 5, y: -3 },
    { x: 5, y: 3 },
    { x: 0, y: 3 },
  ]}
  portHints={["1"]}
  coveredWithSolderMask
/>
```

### The Role of Solder Mask

The `coveredWithSolderMask` property is critical for capacitive touch:

- **`coveredWithSolderMask={true}`** â€” Pad is covered by solder mask
  - Protects copper from oxidation
  - Smooth, consistent surface for touch
  - No solder paste applied
  - Capacitive sensing works through the thin mask layer

- **`coveredWithSolderMask={false}`** â€” Exposed copper
  - Direct contact, can oxidize over time
  - Useful for test points or connectors, not ideal for touch

## Design Tips

### Pad Sizing and Spacing

- **Pad width**: 5mm is a good starting point
- **Pad height**: 6mm provides good finger contact area
- **Gap between pads**: 2-3mm for good sensitivity
- **Don't go below 3mm Ã— 3mm** (manufacturing limitation)

### Ground Plane Strategy

- Keep ground at least 5mm from touch pads
- Use a ground hatch pattern instead of solid pour near sensors
- A ground ring around the slider helps with shielding

### Trace Routing

- Keep traces short and direct to minimize noise
- Route all traces on the same layer as the pads when possible
- Use guard traces between sensitive lines

## Common Use Cases

Capacitive touch sliders are ideal for:

- **Volume controls** on headphones and speakers
- **Brightness dimmers** for LED lighting
- **Color pickers** (multiple sliders for hue/saturation/brightness)
- **Position inputs** in gaming controllers

## Next Steps

- Experiment with different polygon shapes (triangular pads for better interpolation)
- Add LED indicators under each pad for visual feedback
- Try different pad counts for higher or lower resolution
- Connect to a capacitive touch controller IC for real hardware
