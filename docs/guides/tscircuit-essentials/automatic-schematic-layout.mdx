title: Automatic Schematic Layout
description: >-
  Understand how the default schematic autolayout arranges components and
  discover options for nudging results with manual edits and layout helpers.

:::warning
Automatic layout is in beta! We're changing and improving the layout algorithms,
if it doesn't work for you stay tuned! Many changes are on the way!

## Automatic Schematic Layout

Automatic schematic layout is turned on by default, using a pattern matching and
packing algorithm to arrange components in the current schematic.

<CircuitPreview

  code={`
export default () => (
  <board>
    <resistor
      resistance="1k"
      footprint="0402"

      connections={{ pin2: "net.VCC" }}
