# Single Layer Jumper Autorouting

The `auto_jumper` autorouter is designed for **single-layer PCB workflows** where
crossovers are resolved with jumper wires instead of plated vias. Configure your
board with `layers={1}` and `autorouter="auto_jumper"` so the router keeps copper
on one side and inserts jumper components when needed.

This guide covers:

1. Setting up a single-layer board for jumper routing.
2. Adding traces and validating where jumpers are used.

## 1. Configure the board for a single copper layer

Use both `layers={1}` and `autorouter="auto_jumper"` on the board:

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`export default () => (
  <board width="24mm" height="18mm" layers={1} autorouter="auto_jumper">
    <chip name="U1" footprint="soic8" pcbX={-7} pcbY={0} />
    <chip name="U2" footprint="soic8" pcbX={7} pcbY={0} rotation={180} />

    <trace from=".U1 > .pin1" to=".U2 > .pin8" />
    <trace from=".U1 > .pin2" to=".U2 > .pin7" />
    <trace from=".U1 > .pin3" to=".U2 > .pin6" />
    <trace from=".U1 > .pin4" to=".U2 > .pin5" />
  </board>
)`}
/>

When traces must cross, the router can introduce jumper paths to preserve
single-layer manufacturability.

## 2. Route and verify jumper placement

After routing, inspect the PCB preview and manufacturing outputs to ensure:

- All copper traces remain on a single copper layer.
- Jumper insertions are acceptable for assembly and spacing.
- Trace widths and clearances still meet fabrication constraints.

```tsx title="src/single-layer-jumper-example.tsx"
export default () => (
  <board width="30mm" height="20mm" layers={1} autorouter="auto_jumper">
    <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" pcbX={-10} pcbY={4} />
    <resistor name="R2" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" pcbX={10} pcbY={4} />
    <resistor name="R3" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" pcbX={-10} pcbY={-4} />
    <resistor name="R4" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" pcbX={10} pcbY={-4} />

    <trace from="R1.pin2" to="R4.pin1" />
    <trace from="R3.pin2" to="R2.pin1" />
  </board>
)
```

For the best results, keep part placement orderly and leave vertical clearance
where you expect jumpers to bridge crossing routes.
