# Single Layer Jumper Autorouting

The `auto_jumper` autorouter is designed for **single-layer PCB workflows** where
crossovers are resolved with jumper wires instead of plated vias. Configure your
board with `layers={1}` and `autorouter="auto_jumper"` so the router keeps copper
on one side and inserts jumper components when needed.

This guide covers:

1. Setting up a single-layer board for jumper routing.
2. Adding traces and validating where jumpers are used.

## 1. Configure the board for a single copper layer

Use both `layers={1}` and `autorouter="auto_jumper"` on the board:

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`export default () => (
  <board width="24mm" height="18mm" layers={1} autorouter="auto_jumper">
    <chip name="U1" footprint="soic8" pcbX={-7} pcbY={0} />
    <chip name="U2" footprint="soic8" pcbX={7} pcbY={0} rotation={180} />

    <trace from=".U1 > .pin1" to=".U2 > .pin8" />
    <trace from=".U1 > .pin2" to=".U2 > .pin7" />
    <trace from=".U1 > .pin3" to=".U2 > .pin6" />
    <trace from=".U1 > .pin4" to=".U2 > .pin5" />
  </board>
)`}
/>

When traces must cross, the router can introduce jumper paths to preserve
single-layer manufacturability.
