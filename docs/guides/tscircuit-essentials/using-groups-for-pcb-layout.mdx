title: Using Groups for PCB Layout
description: >-
  Groups can help you break up your layout problem into smaller, more manageable
  and reusable parts.
---

`<group />` elements allow you to move chips together, keep chips
contained within a a smaller area, or apply different layout engines and
techniques for different areas of your board.

tscircuit `<group />` elements are a lot like HTML `<div />` elements. They can
contain other elements for the purpose of applying different layout engines,
like flexbox or grid, or to move multiple elements at once.

In tscircuit, we have two main main types of positioning modes:

- `relative` position. In this mode, your position is relative to your "container"
  or parent element. You can set `pcbX` or `pcbY`, or even set constraints like
  "I should be 1mm away from some other element"
- `pack` layout. In this layout mode, things are packed together with a strategy
  you specify. By default, we pack to minimize trace distance using a pack order
  from largest to smallest.

## Relative Positioning

> TODO coming soon!

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`
  export default () => (
    <board>
      <group pcbX={4}>
        <resistor pcbX={2} name="R1" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" />
      </group>
    </board>
  )
`} />

## Automatic Packing
