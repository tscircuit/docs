You can generate a pinout diagram for your board. This is useful for creating reference diagrams for modules or development boards.

To include a pin in the pinout diagram, you need to add the `pinAttributes` prop to your component and set `includeInBoardPinout: true` for the desired pins.

Here is an example using a Raspberry Pi Pico W component. We enable all pins to be included in the pinout.

<CircuitPreview
  showPinoutTab={true}
  defaultView="pinout"
  fsMap={{
    "index.tsx": `
import { PICO_W } from "@tsci/ShiboSoftwareDev.pico-w"

export default () => {
  const pinAttributes: any = {}
  for (let i = 1; i <= 46; i++) {
    pinAttributes[\`pin\${i}\`] = { includeInBoardPinout: true }
  }

  return (
    <board>
      <PICO_W name="U1" pcbRotation="-90deg" pinAttributes={pinAttributes} />
    </board>
  )
}
`
  }}
/>
