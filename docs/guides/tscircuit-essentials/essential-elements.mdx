## Overview

There are some essential elements you'll need for almost every circuit you make,
this doc gives a brief overview of each of them so you can jump right in and
get started building electronics!

| Element                                      | Description                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`<board />`](../../elements/board.mdx)         | The root element of a circuit, defines the size of the board and settings like the autorouting method that should be used |
| [`<chip />`](../../elements/chip.mdx)           | A packaged integrated circuit (IC).                                                                                       |
| [`<trace />`](../../elements/trace.mdx)         | Represents a connection between different chips.                                                                          |
| [`<led />`](../../elements/led.mdx)             | Light emitting diode, a small light often used to represent power or status indicators                                    |
| [`<resistor />`](../../elements/resistor.mdx)   | Resists the flow of electrical current.                                                                                   |
| [`<capacitor />`](../../elements/capacitor.mdx) | Stores electrical charge. Often used to smooth out voltage fluctuations.                                                  |
| [`<diode />`](../../elements/diode.mdx)         | Allows current to flow in one direction.                                                                                  |

## The Essential Elements

### [`<board />`](../../elements/board.mdx)

The `<board />` element is the root container for your circuit, similar to how `<body />` works in HTML. Every circuit needs a board! You can customize the size using `width` and `height` props, or even create custom board outlines for non-rectangular shapes.

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`

export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <resistor resistance="1k" footprint="0402" name="R1" />
    </board>
)`
} />

### [`<chip />`](../../elements/chip.mdx)

The `<chip />` element is the most versatile component in tscircuit - it can represent virtually any packaged electronic component. You specify a footprint and pin labels, and can customize how it appears in both schematic and PCB views. Here's a simple example:

<CircuitPreview defaultView="schematic" code={`
export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <chip
        name="U1" 
        footprint="soic8"
        pinLabels={{
          pin1: "VCC",
          pin2: "DISCH", 
          pin3: "THRES",
          pin4: "CTRL",
          pin5: "GND",
          pin6: "TRIG",
          pin7: "OUT",
          pin8: "RESET"
        }}
      />
    </board>
)`} />

You can control pin arrangements, add custom footprints, specify internally connected pins, and more. The `<chip />` element is commonly used for ICs, connectors, buttons, and other discrete components.
