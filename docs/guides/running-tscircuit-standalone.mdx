title: Running tscircuit with a script tag
description: Load `tscircuit`'s browser build from a CDN and render a circuit written inside a `<script type="tscircuit-tsx">` block â€“ no build tooling required.

## Overview

The `tscircuit` package ships a single-file distribution (`browser.min.js`) that can be loaded directly in the browser.  
When this file is present on the page it will look for any `<script>` tags with the special type `tscircuit-tsx`, compile the content on-the-fly, and mount the rendered circuit into the page body.

This makes it possible to embed tscircuit examples in any static HTML page without Webpack, Vite, or a React build step.

Here's a minimal **stand-alone** HTML page that renders a resistor inside a board:

<TscircuitCdnCodeBlockExample />

The first script tag downloads the standalone bundle which brings in React, tscircuit, and the on-page compiler.  
Finally, the second script tag contains the JSX (technically TSX) that defines your circuit.  
When the browser finishes parsing, `browser.min.js` compiles this TSX and injects the resulting circuit right where the script tag is placed (the default is the end of the `<body>` tag).

## Live example

Below is the same snippet executed inside an **actual `<iframe>`** (no special React wrapper is used).

<TscircuitCdnIframeExample />
