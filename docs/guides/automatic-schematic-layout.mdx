:::warning
Automatic layout is in beta! We're changing and improving the layout algorithms,
if it doesn't work for you stay tuned! Many changes are on the way!

## Automatic Schematic Layout

Automatic schematic layout is turned on by default with the `matchAdapt` algorithm,
this algorithm looks inside a corpus of schematic templates and matches the current
schematic to the best matching template, then lays out the remaining components.
