title: Displaying Circuit JSON on a Webpage
description: Render Circuit JSON in web apps using RunFrame and related components
---

[Circuit JSON](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json) is a universal
intermediary format for representing an electronic circuit. It contains PCB,
Schematic, 3D, Bill of Materials and simulation information.

tscircuit code always converts into Circuit JSON, which can be displayed in
any of our React components

:::tip
You can also upload your Circuit JSON to [circuitjson.com](https://circuitjson.com)
for a quick preview!

## React: Display all available previews with `<CircuitJsonPreview />`

The `<CircuitJsonPreview />` component is a simple way to display all available
previews for a Circuit JSON array. You can use it by installing the `@tscircuit/runframe`
package and importing it into your `React` project.

```tsx
import { CircuitJsonPreview } from "@tscircuit/runframe"
import { renderToCircuitJson } from "lib/dev/render-to-circuit-json"

export default () => (
  <CircuitJsonPreview
    circuitJson={renderToCircuitJson(
      <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
        <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" />
      </board>,
    )}
  />
)
```

You should see something like this:

and the [examples directory](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/tree/main/examples)!

:::info
Have tscircuit code and want to skip converting to Circuit JSON? Try using the
`<RunFrame />` component directly to build your circuit in the browser!

### React: Running tscircuit code in the browser (no Circuit JSON needed!)

The `<RunFrame />` component is a simple way to run tscircuit code in the browser.
RunFrame loads the tscircuit runtime (and all the dependencies to build Typescript
code) into a WebWorker and runs the code in the background.

To use RunFrame, you must provide a `fsMap` object. This object maps file paths
to file contents. Files inside this "filesystem map" can import each other, this
is super useful when you have many files to import such as a `manual-edits.json`
file!

```tsx
import { RunFrame } from "@tscircuit/runframe"

export default () => (
  <RunFrame
    fsMap={{
      "main.tsx":
`
circuit.add(
  <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
    <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" />
    <capacitor name="C1" capacitance="1uF" footprint="0603" pcbX={4} />
    <trace from=".R1 .pin1" to=".C1 .pin1" />
  </board>
)
`,
    }}
    entrypoint="main.tsx"
  />
)
```

You can see different examples of how RunFrame looks for different circuits
on the [RunFrame online examples page](https://runframe.vercel.app/)

`<RunFrame />` automatically handles imports from the tscircuit registry
