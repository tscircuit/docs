`tsci build --site` packages your tscircuit project into a static website that anyone can browse without running a server. The command evaluates your circuits, exports the generated assets into a `dist` folder, and wires them up to the tscircuit RunFrame viewer so visitors can flip between PCB, schematic, and 3D previews right in the browser.

The [Common tscircuit gallery](https://common.tscircuit.com/) is an example of a site generated with this workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before building a site, make sure you have:

- A tscircuit project with one or more `*.circuit.tsx` files or another supported entrypoint.
- The tscircuit CLI installed (`npm install -g tsci`, `bunx tsci`, or `npx tsci`).
- Any dependencies that your circuits import (registry components, local packages, etc.).

## Building the site

Run the build command from the root of your project:

```bash
# generates dist/index.html and other assets
npx tsci build --site
```

The CLI resolves your entrypoint, evaluates every circuit, and then writes a static site to `dist/site/` alongside the usual `dist/circuit.json` outputs. The generated folder contains:

- `index.html` – a ready-to-host viewer.
- `lib/…/circuit.json` – one JSON file per design so the viewer can lazy load each project.
- Supporting JavaScript, CSS, and WebAssembly bundles for the RunFrame UI.

You can inspect the result locally with any static file server, for example:

```bash
npx serve dist
```

Opening `http://localhost:3000` (or the port reported by your static server) shows the same interactive viewer experience used at common.tscircuit.com.

## Customizing the catalog

The site automatically lists every circuit that `tsci build` evaluates. If you already use a `tscircuit.config.json` file, the same settings shape the static catalog: `mainEntrypoint` lets you pick a custom starting file, and the existing include/exclude patterns limit which `*.circuit.tsx` sources are exported.

When you add extra documentation or screenshots, keep them in a public asset folder (for example `public/`), then point to them from your circuits. Static assets referenced at build time are copied into `dist` so they ship with the site bundle.

## Deploying to Vercel

Vercel can host the generated site without any special adapters:

1. Push your project to GitHub or GitLab.
2. Create a new Vercel project that points to the repository.
3. Set the **Build Command** to `npx tsci build --site` (or `bunx tsci build --site` if you prefer Bun).
4. Set the **Output Directory** to `dist`.
5. Trigger a deploy – Vercel runs the build, uploads the static folder, and serves it on your chosen domain.

For preview deployments, Vercel repeats these steps on every pull request so reviewers can browse the circuits before merging.

## Deploying elsewhere

Because the output is plain HTML/JS/CSS, you can host it almost anywhere:

- **GitHub Pages** – run `npx tsci build --site` in CI and publish the `dist` folder to `gh-pages`.
- **Netlify** – configure the build command and output directory just like Vercel.
- **S3/CloudFront or static buckets** – upload the generated files with `aws s3 sync dist s3://your-bucket`.

Once deployed, the site stays fast and inexpensive to serve because no server-side rendering or API proxy is required—the viewer fetches the prebuilt `circuit.json` files directly from storage.
