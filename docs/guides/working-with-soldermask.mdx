## What is Soldermask?

Soldermask is a protective layer applied to printed circuit boards (PCBs) that:

- Prevents solder from bridging between adjacent pads and traces
- Protects copper traces from oxidation and environmental damage
- Provides electrical insulation

## Configuring Soldermask on Holes

You can control soldermask behavior on individual holes using these properties:

- `coveredWithSolderMask`: Boolean - Whether the hole is covered with soldermask (default: false)
- `solderMaskMargin`: Number - Margin around the hole in millimeters; positive extends soldermask outward from hole edge, negative pulls it back (default: 0)

## Manufacturing Considerations

- Always verify with your manufacturer's capabilities and design rules
- Most fabricators have minimum soldermask clearance requirements
- Check your fabrication service's design rules before finalizing margins
