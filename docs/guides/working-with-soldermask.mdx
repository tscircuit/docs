## What is Soldermask?

Soldermask is a protective layer applied to printed circuit boards (PCBs) that:

- Prevents solder from bridging between adjacent pads and traces
- Protects copper traces from oxidation and environmental damage
- Provides electrical insulation
- Helps with component placement during assembly
- Can be configured with different margins around features like holes and pads

In tscircuit, soldermask is automatically included in your fabrication files and can be visualized in the PCB viewer.

## Configuring Soldermask on Holes

You can control soldermask behavior on individual holes using these properties:

- `coveredWithSolderMask`: Boolean - Whether the hole should have soldermask applied
- `solderMaskMargin`: Number - Additional margin around the hole in millimeters (can be negative)

## Soldermask Margin Guidelines

### Positive Margins (Recommended for most holes)
- `0.1mm - 0.2mm`: Standard margin for plated through-holes
- `0.15mm`: Good balance between protection and accessibility
- `0.25mm`: Extra protection for high-reliability applications

### Negative Margins (Special cases)
- `-0.05mm to -0.1mm`: For holes that need better solder flow or test access
- Use sparingly and only when necessary for specific manufacturing requirements

### When to Use Different Margins
- **Standard mounting holes**: Use positive margins (0.1mm - 0.2mm)
- **Fiducial holes**: Often use negative margins for better camera recognition
- **Test points**: May use negative margins for probe access
- **High-density designs**: Consider tighter positive margins

## Manufacturing Considerations

- Soldermask margins affect the final hole size in your fabrication files
- Always verify with your manufacturer's capabilities and design rules
- Most fabricators have minimum soldermask clearance requirements
- Check your fabrication service's design rules before finalizing margins
