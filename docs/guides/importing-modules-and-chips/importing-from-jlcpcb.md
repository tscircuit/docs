# Importing from JLCPCB

## Using RunFrame

RunFrame provides a seamless way to import JLCPCB components directly into your TSCircuit project. Here's how to get started:

1. Launch TSCircuit by running `tsci dev` in your terminal
2. In the TSCircuit interface, navigate to "File -> Import"
3. Select "Import from JLCPCB" from the import options
4. You'll be presented with the RunFrame interface where you can:
   - Search for components by part number or description
   - Browse through JLCPCB's extensive component library
   - View detailed specifications and datasheets
   - Preview component footprints and 3D models

### Key Features

- **Direct Integration**: Components are imported with their complete specifications, including:

  - Electrical parameters
  - Physical dimensions
  - Recommended footprints
  - 3D models
  - Availability and pricing information

- **Smart Search**: Find components quickly using:

  - Part numbers
  - Component descriptions
  - Categories
  - Manufacturers

- **Real-time Updates**: Component data is always up-to-date with JLCPCB's inventory

### Best Practices

1. Always verify component specifications after import
2. Check component availability before finalizing your design
3. Review the recommended footprint matches your requirements
4. Consider ordering a small batch first for testing

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during import:

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Verify that the component exists in JLCPCB's catalog
- Check if the component has complete documentation
- Try refreshing the RunFrame interface
