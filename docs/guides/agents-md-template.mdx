# AGENTS.md — Agent Configuration Template

This template helps AI assistants understand how to interact with tscircuit projects. Copy this file into your project root and customize it for your specific needs.

---

## 📋 Project Context

Describe your project, goals, constraints, and any relevant hardware requirements. Include information about:
- Project objectives and scope
- Target hardware platform(s)
- Key components and design decisions
- Any project-specific conventions

## 🔧 tscircuit Syntax Primer

Provide examples of how your project uses tscircuit components. AI tools will reference these when generating code:

```tsx
<resistor name="R1" resistance="10k" footprint="0805" />
<led name="LED1" color="red" footprint="led0603" />
<trace from="R1.pin1" to="LED1.pin1" />
<chip name="IC1" model="ATmega328P" footprint="dip28" />
```

Include common patterns, naming conventions, and component selections used in your project.

## ⚙️ tscircuit CLI Commands

List the CLI commands that AI tools may need to run during development:

```bash
bun run dev      # Start development server
bun run build    # Build the project
tsci export      # Export design (Gerber, BOM, etc.)
tsci search      # Search for components
```

## 🚀 Development Workflow

Explain your project's development process:
- How to test changes
- Where to place new components
- Git workflow and branch naming conventions
- Build and validation steps

## ⛔ Constraints for Assistants

**Do's:**
- Modify files in `/src` and `/docs` as needed
- Test changes before committing
- Provide clear commit messages
- Ask for clarification on requirements

**Don'ts:**
- Do not modify configuration files without approval
- Do not create breaking changes without discussion
- Do not commit directly to main branch
- Keep changes small and focused
