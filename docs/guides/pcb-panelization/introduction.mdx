## What is Panelization?

Panelization arranges multiple PCBs on one large panel for manufacturing. After fabrication, boards are separated using breakable tabs.

## Quick Start

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="pcb"
  code={`
export default () => (
  <panel width="100mm" height="50mm">
    <board width="40mm" height="40mm" routingDisabled>
      <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" />
    </board>
    <board width="40mm" height="40mm" routingDisabled>
      <resistor name="R2" resistance="10k" footprint="0402" />
    </board>
  </panel>
)
`}
/>

## Key Features

- **Auto-layout**: Boards arranged automatically in a grid
- **Tab routing**: Breakable tabs generated between boards
- **Mouse bites**: Small holes for easy separation
- **Auto-sizing**: Panel dimensions calculated automatically

## Basic Rules

1. `<panel>` must be at root level (not inside a board)
2. Only `<board>` elements can be direct children
3. One panel per circuit
4. Use `routingDisabled` on boards to prevent cross-panel traces
