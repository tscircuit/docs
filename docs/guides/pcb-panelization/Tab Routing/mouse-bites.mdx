## What Are Mouse Bites?

Small perforated holes along the tab line that make it easier to snap boards apart cleanly.

## Configuration

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `mouseBites` | boolean | true | Enable/disable mouse bites |

**Mouse bite diameter** = 0.45 × `tabWidth` (automatically calculated)

## With Mouse Bites (Default)

```tsx
<panel mouseBites={true}>
  <board width="40mm" height="40mm" routingDisabled />
  <board width="40mm" height="40mm" routingDisabled />
</panel>
```

## Without Mouse Bites

For cleaner edges (requires sawing or routing to separate):

```tsx
<panel mouseBites={false}>
  <board width="40mm" height="40mm" routingDisabled />
  <board width="40mm" height="40mm" routingDisabled />
</panel>
```

## When to Disable

- **V-scoring** will be used instead
- **Clean edges** required for enclosure fit
- **Automated depaneling** equipment available
