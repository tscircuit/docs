tscircuit code, like React code, is distributed as a "package". `tsci push` pushes your package to [tscircuit registry](https://tscircuit.com/trending) to enable sharing with your team.

After publishing, you can use the [tsci add](https://docs.tscircuit.com/command-line/tsci-add) command to install your package as part of a larger circuit.

After you run `tsci push` you can see a your snippet file on your tscircuit account.
